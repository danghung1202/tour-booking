As a User, I want a consistent and clean layout with a main navigation bar, so that I can easily move between the main sections of the platform.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A responsive layout shell is created with a header, main content area, and footer.
- [ ] The header displays the platform name and navigation links (e.g., Home, Tours, Browse by Category, Login/Register).
- [ ] Navigation links adapt based on the user's authentication status and role.
- [ ] The visual style is minimalist and modern, inspired by `atasteofhanoi.com`.
