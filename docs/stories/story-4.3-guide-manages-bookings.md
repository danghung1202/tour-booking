As a Tour Guide, I want to view and manage incoming booking requests, so that I can confirm or cancel them and communicate the status to the tourist.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A "Manage Bookings" page in the guide's dashboard lists all bookings for their tours.
- [ ] Each booking entry displays the tourist's details, requested date/time, and a status (e.g., 'pending', 'confirmed', 'cancelled').
- [ ] The guide receives an email notification for each new booking request.
- [ ] The guide can change a 'pending' booking's status to 'confirmed' or 'cancelled_by_guide'.
- [ ] Changing the status triggers an email notification to the tourist with the updated status.
