# Story 1.7 Initial Admin User Creation Process

- **Epic:** [Epic 1: Project Foundation & Core Platform Setup](https://www.notion.so/Epic-1-Project-Foundation-Core-Platform-Setup-e61649472398458995543c535414c53c)
- **Status:** To Do
- **Points:** 2

---

As a Developer, I need a secure, one-time process to create the first Admin account, so that platform oversight can be established.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A secure script or manual Supabase SQL query is used to assign the 'admin' role to a specific, pre-registered user.
- [ ] The process is documented for the project owner or lead developer to execute.
- [ ] This process is designed for initial setup only and not for ongoing admin creation.
