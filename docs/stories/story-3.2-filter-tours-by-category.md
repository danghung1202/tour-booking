As a Tourist, I want to filter the list of tours by a specific category, so that I can more easily find the type of experience I am interested in.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] On the main tour browsing page, a list of available tour categories is displayed.
- [ ] Clicking on a category name filters the tour list to show only tours belonging to that category.
- [ ] A category-specific page exists (e.g., `/tours/culinary`) that displays only tours from that category.
- [ ] The filtering mechanism updates the displayed tours without a full page reload where possible.
