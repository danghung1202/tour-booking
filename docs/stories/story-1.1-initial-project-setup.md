As a Developer, I want to set up a new Next.js project with TypeScript, connect it to a Supabase backend, and establish a basic CI/CD pipeline to Vercel, so that we have a foundational, deployable codebase to build upon.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A new Next.js application is initialized with TypeScript.
- [ ] The application is configured to connect to the Supabase project using environment variables.
- [ ] The project is pushed to a Git repository.
- [ ] A Vercel project is created and linked to the Git repository for automated deployments.
- [ ] Successful pushes to the `main` branch deploy automatically to Vercel production.
