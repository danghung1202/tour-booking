As a Tour Guide, I want to manage my availability by setting specific dates as unavailable and defining the standard time slots for my tours, so that tourists can only book times when I am actually available.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A "Manage Availability" section exists in the guide's dashboard.
- [ ] The guide can select one of their tours to manage its availability.
- [ ] The interface includes a calendar where the guide can select and save dates as "unavailable."
- [ ] The guide can define a list of standard start times (time slots) for a specific tour.
- [ ] This availability data (`tour_availability` and `tour_time_slots`) is used to populate the booking calendar on the tourist-facing tour detail page.
