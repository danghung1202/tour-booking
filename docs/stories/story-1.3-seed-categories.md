As a Developer, I want to populate the database with an initial, fixed list of tour categories during setup, so that these are available for guides to use when creating tours and for tourists to use for filtering.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A `categories` table (or equivalent simple structure) is created in the Supabase database.
- [ ] The table is populated with an initial, predefined list of categories (e.g., 'Day tours', 'Night tours', 'Adventure', 'Cultural', 'Culinary').
- [ ] The category list is accessible by the application for use in the tour creation form and tour filtering features.
