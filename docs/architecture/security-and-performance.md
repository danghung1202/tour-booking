# Security and Performance

This section outlines the strategies for ensuring the platform is secure, reliable, and performant.

### Security

*   **Authentication & Authorization:**
    *   Handled by Supabase Auth, which provides secure JWT-based authentication.
    *   Row-Level Security (RLS) policies will be implemented extensively in Supabase to enforce data access rules at the database level. This is the primary mechanism for ensuring users can only access data they are permitted to see.
    *   Next.js API routes will validate user roles and permissions on the server side before executing any sensitive operations.
*   **Data Security:**
    *   All communication is over HTTPS.
    *   Secret keys and credentials (like `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) are stored as environment variables in Vercel, never in the codebase.
    *   Input validation will be performed on all user-submitted data to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQLi, XSS).
*   **Compliance:**
    *   The platform will adhere to the principles of data minimization and privacy by design to align with regulations like Vietnam's Decree 13.
    *   A clear privacy policy will be accessible to all users.

### Performance

*   **Frontend Performance:**
    *   **Framework:** Next.js provides performance optimizations out-of-the-box, including automatic code splitting, optimized image loading (`next/image`), and prefetching of links.
    *   **Hosting:** Vercel's global Edge Network (CDN) serves static assets and pages from locations close to the user, minimizing latency.
    *   **Caching:** Vercel automatically caches static pages and assets. For dynamic data, we will use React's built-in caching and state management, which is sufficient for the MVP.
*   **Backend Performance:**
    *   **Database:** Supabase is built on PostgreSQL, which is highly performant. We will ensure that database queries are optimized and that appropriate indexes are created on tables for frequently queried columns (e.g., foreign keys, status columns).
    *   **Serverless Functions:** Next.js API routes on Vercel are serverless functions that scale automatically with demand.
