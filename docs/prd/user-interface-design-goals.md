## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The platform will project trustworthiness as a go-to source for unique, authentic local tours. The design will be minimalist, modern, clean, and visually appealing, inspired by `atasteofhanoi.com`, to emphasize the uniqueness of the tours and guides' stories. The user journey for both tourists (discovery to booking and cancellation) and guides (tour creation to managing bookings) must be intuitive and straightforward.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

* **Tourists:** Seamless Browse of tour listings with clear calls-to-action, simple search and category filtering, an intuitive booking process, and a straightforward method for cancellation (via account or secure email link).
* **Tour Guides:** An easy-to-use interface for creating and managing tour listings, including a rich-text editor and category assignment. A simple mechanism for managing availability and a clear presentation of bookings and cancellations.
* **Admin:** Efficient tools for user and tour management with a clear dashboard for key metrics.

### Core Screens and Views

* **Tourist-Facing:**
    * Homepage/Tour Discovery (featuring unique tours, search/filter, category navigation)
    * Category-specific Tour Listing Page
    * Tour Detail Page (comprehensive info including category, Guide's Story, guide bio, booking interface, contact option)
    * Booking Confirmation Page
    * Booking Cancellation Interface/Page
    * Simple login/registration for booking.
* **Guide-Facing:**
    * Dashboard (overview of listings, bookings including cancellations)
    * Tour Creation/Editing Interface (with category selection)
    * Availability Management Interface
    * Booking Management Interface (showing cancelled status)

    * (Behind the scenes) Predefined list of Categories for assignment.

### Accessibility: None

For the MVP, advanced accessibility features are a lower priority due to the aggressive timeline. Basic usability will be the focus.

### Branding

* **Platform Name:** "Unique Tours Platform".
* **Core Message:** Emphasis on "unique, offbeat, authentic local experiences".
* **Visual Style:** Clean, minimalist, and modern, inspired by `atasteofhanoi.com`.
* **Color Palette:** Should align with the aesthetic and color scheme observed on `https://atasteofhanoi.com/`.

### Target Device and Platforms

The MVP will be a web application designed with a "mobile-first responsive" approach, ensuring it functions effectively on both desktop and mobile browsers.
