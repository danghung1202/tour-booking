## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

* Establish the platform as the leading online destination for unique, authentic, and offbeat global tour experiences.
* Empower local tour guides by providing a platform to share their passions and manage their niche offerings effectively.
* Enable travelers to discover and book unforgettable, off-the-beaten-path adventures.
* Successfully launch an MVP within a 1-week development timeframe featuring core functionalities for tourists, guides, and administrators.
* Onboard 5-10 guides with 10-15 tours and achieve 5-10 bookings within the first two weeks of launch.
* Gather feedback from early adopters to guide future development.

### Background Context

The current tourism market is saturated with large platforms focusing on mainstream tours, making it difficult for travelers to find unique, local experiences. Concurrently, local guides offering these specialized tours lack visibility on platforms tailored to their needs.

The Unique Tours Platform will bridge this gap by creating a dedicated marketplace connecting these guides with travelers seeking authentic experiences. It will provide guides with tools to create, promote, and manage their tours, emphasizing rich storytelling. For tourists, it will be a trusted source for booking memorable, non-traditional adventures, solving the discovery problem for both sides of the market.
