## Next Steps

### Design Architect Prompt

**Objective:** Elaborate on the UI/UX aspects of the product defined in this PRD for the "Unique Tours Platform".
**Mode:** UI/UX Specification Mode
**Input:** This completed PRD document (Unique Tours Platform PRD v1.2).
**Key Tasks:**
1.  Review the product goals, user stories (including cancellation, categories features), user interaction and design goals, and any UI-related notes herein. Pay special attention to the visual inspiration from `atasteofhanoi.com` and the mobile-first responsive requirement.
2.  Collaboratively define detailed user flows for key tasks (e.g., tourist booking including cancellation flows, guide tour creation including category assignment, tourist browse/filtering by categories).
3.  Create wireframes and key screen mockups that align with the minimalist, modern aesthetic for all core flows.
4.  Specify usability requirements and any basic accessibility considerations feasible for MVP.
5.  Ensure the resulting UI/UX specification document clearly links back to and complements this PRD.

### Architect Prompt

Based on the requirements in this PRD (v1.2), please create the technical architecture and solution design for the Unique Tours Platform MVP.

**Key Technical Constraints & Guidance:**
* **Architecture:** Use a monorepo with a monolithic Next.js application and Supabase as the BaaS.
* **Technology Stack:** Next.js (React), Node.js, and PostgreSQL via Supabase are mandated.
* **Database:** The schema **must** be designed for future "Organization Model" extensibility as detailed in Story 1.2 and the Technical Assumptions.
* **Timeline & Budget:** The original 1-week timeline is now significantly impacted by new features. Please provide a revised estimate. The initial monthly hosting budget is $50-$100.
* **Testing:** The MVP will rely on structured manual testing and focused integration testing for critical paths like booking, cancellation, and tour creation.
* **Points for Investigation:** Please address spam protection for guest forms, secure guest cancellation link implementation, efficient database querying for categories/filters, and ensuring the data model correctly anticipates future needs without over-complicating the MVP.
