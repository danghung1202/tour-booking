Of course. For an MVP, creating static article pages is an excellent way to provide valuable content without the overhead of a full CMS.

I will create a two-part prompt. The first part will define a reusable **Article Page Template** to ensure all future articles have a consistent look and feel. The second part will be a prompt to create a **specific, example article** using that template, complete with suggested content relevant to your platform.

-----

### Prompt 1: Reusable Article Page Template


Create a reusable, generic "Article Page Template" for displaying static content like blog posts or guides.

## 1. High-Level Goal

Build a dynamic route and layout at `articles/[slug]/page.tsx` that will serve as the template for all static articles. This template will define the structure and styling for an article's title, metadata, header image, and main content body to ensure a consistent, readable, and professional appearance.

## 2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Create the Dynamic Route File (`app/articles/[slug]/page.tsx`):**
    * This will be a server component that fetches the content for a specific article based on the `slug` from the URL.
    * For the MVP, we will simulate this "fetch" by creating a central function or object that maps a `slug` to its static content.

2.  **Create a Content Management System (Mock):**
    * In a new file, for example `lib/articles.ts`, create a simple data structure (like an array of objects) to hold the content for all static articles. Each object should have a `slug`, `title`, `author`, `date`, `headerImageUrl`, and `content` (which will be JSX or HTML).
    * The `page.tsx` component will import from this file and find the article where `article.slug === params.slug`. If not found, it should trigger a 404.

3.  **Define the Article Page Layout:**
    * **Header Image:** At the top of the page, display the article's `headerImageUrl` as a full-width, visually impactful image.
    * **Article Header:** Below the image, in a centered content column, display:
        * The `title` of the article as a large `<h1>`.
        * The article's metadata, such as "Posted by [Author] on [Date]".
    * **Article Body:**
        * Render the `content` of the article.
        * The content area should have a maximum width to ensure readability (e.g., `720px`) and be centered.
        * The typography should use the established fonts: `var(--font-primary)` for headings within the content and `var(--font-secondary)` for paragraphs.

## 3. Define a Strict Scope

* You should **ONLY** create or modify the following files:
    * `app/articles/[slug]/page.tsx`
    * `app/articles/[slug]/page.module.css`
    * `lib/articles.ts` (for the mock CMS)
* This prompt is for creating the **template** and the system for rendering articles. Do not create the content for any specific article yet.

### Prompt 2: Example Article Page ("A Taste of History")

This prompt will create the content for a specific article, which will then be rendered by the template created above.


Create the content for a new static article titled "A Taste of History: Exploring the Timeless Flavors of Hanoi's Old Quarter".

## 1. High-Level Goal

Add a new article's content to the mock CMS created in `lib/articles.ts`. This will demonstrate how the Article Page Template is used to render a real article. The content should be engaging and relevant to the platform's focus on authentic local experiences.

## 2. Detailed Instructions

1.  **Locate the Mock CMS File (`lib/articles.ts`):**
    * Open the file where the static article data is stored.

2.  **Add a New Article Object:**
    * Add a new object to the articles array. This object will contain all the content for our example article.

## 3. Article Content

Use the following data for the new article object:

```javascript
{
  slug: 'hanoi-old-quarter-food-history',
  title: "A Taste of History: Exploring the Timeless Flavors of Hanoi's Old Quarter",
  author: "Sally (UX Expert)",
  date: "July 9, 2025",
  headerImageUrl: '[https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1555939594-58d7cb561ad1?q=80&w=2787&auto=format&fit=crop](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1555939594-58d7cb561ad1?q=80&w=2787&auto=format&fit=crop)', // A relevant, high-quality image URL

    <>
      <p>Hanoi's Old Quarter is not just a collection of ancient streets; it's a living museum of Vietnamese culture, and nowhere is this more apparent than in its food. For centuries, the 36 streets of this historic district have been serving up dishes whose recipes have been passed down through generations. To truly understand Hanoi, you must first taste it.</p>
      
      <h2>The Philosophy of Street Food</h2>
      <p>Unlike fine dining, Hanoi's street food is built on specialization. A family might spend their entire lives perfecting a single dish, like Phở or Bún Chả. This dedication creates a level of mastery that is hard to find anywhere else. Each stall, each cart, is a testament to a family's legacy and a city's culinary soul.</p>

      <h3>Must-Try Dishes and Where to Find Them:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Phở Bò (Beef Noodle Soup):</strong> The quintessential Vietnamese dish. The best Phở is often found in unassuming, generations-old establishments where the broth has been simmering for hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Bún Chả (Grilled Pork with Noodles):</strong> Famously enjoyed by President Barack Obama, this dish features smoky grilled pork patties served in a sweet and savory dipping sauce with fresh rice noodles and herbs.</li>
        * **Bánh Mì (Vietnamese Sandwich):** A perfect fusion of French colonial legacy and Vietnamese flavors, featuring a crispy baguette filled with pâté, cold cuts, fresh herbs, and pickled vegetables.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>More Than Just a Meal</h2>
      <p>Eating in the Old Quarter is an experience. It's about pulling up a tiny plastic stool on a crowded sidewalk, surrounded by the symphony of city life, and enjoying a meal that is both incredibly delicious and deeply connected to the history of the place. It's a culinary journey that connects you directly to the heart of Hanoi.</p>
    </>

}
```

## 4. Define a Strict Scope

  * You should ONLY add a new entry to the data structure within `lib/articles.ts`.
  * Do not modify the article template or any other part of the application.
