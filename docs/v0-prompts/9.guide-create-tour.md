Create a "Create New Tour" page and form for authenticated guides. The page will be a comprehensive form for all tour details, including a rich-text editor and direct-to-storage image uploading.

## 1. High-Level Goal

Build the page at the `/dashboard/tours/create` route. This page must contain a form that allows an authenticated guide to input all the necessary information for a new tour listing. The form must include fields for title, description, price, location, capacity, and more. Key features include a rich-text editor for the "Guide's Story" and a multi-image uploader that sends files directly to Supabase Storage. On submission, the new tour is saved with a "draft" status.

## 2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Create the Page File (`app/dashboard/tours/create/page.tsx`):**
    * This page must be a client component (`'use client';`) to handle the form's state and user interactions.
    * It should have a main heading like `<h1>Create a New Tour</h1>`.

2.  **Build the Tour Form:**
    * Use `useState` to manage the state for all form fields.
    * **Standard Inputs:** Create input fields for the following tour properties:
        * `title` (text input)
        * `description` (textarea)
        * `price` (number input)
        * `duration` (text input, e.g., "3 hours")
        * `location` (text input)
        * `capacity` (number input)
        * `general_availability_info` (textarea)
    * **Category Dropdown:** Add a `<select>` dropdown for the `category_id`. This should be populated by fetching all available categories from the database.
    * **Rich-Text Editor:** For the `story_html` field, integrate a lightweight rich-text editor component to allow guides to craft their story with formatting like bold, italics, and lists.
    * **Image Uploader Component:**
        * Create a dedicated component for handling multiple image uploads.
        * This component will upload files selected by the user directly to a "tour-images" bucket in Supabase Storage.
        * It should display image thumbnails and upload progress.
        * Upon successful upload of all images, it must return an array of the public URLs. This array will be stored in the main form's state.

3.  **Implement Form Submission:**
    * Include a "Save as Draft" button to submit the form.
    * The submit handler will gather all data from the form state, including the array of image URLs.
    * It will call a new service function, `tourService.createTour(tourData)`. The `status` field in `tourData` should be hardcoded to `'draft'`.
    * After the service call succeeds, redirect the user back to the "My Tours" page at `/dashboard/tours`.

## 3. Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints

* **Technology Stack:** The implementation must use Next.js (~14.2) with the App Router, TypeScript, and CSS Modules.
* **File Uploads:** Image files **MUST** be uploaded on the client-side directly to Supabase Storage. The backend API should only receive the resulting string array of image URLs, not the raw file data.
* **API Endpoint:** The `createTour` service function will make a `POST` request to a new protected endpoint, `/api/v1/my-tours`.
* **API Request Payload:** The request body sent to the API should conform to the following TypeScript interface:
    ```typescript
    interface NewTourData {
      title: string;
      description: string;
      story_html: string;
      price: number;
      duration: string;
      location: string;
      capacity: number;
      images: string[]; // Array of URLs from Supabase Storage
      general_availability_info: string;
      category_id: string; // UUID of the selected category
    }
    ```
* **Initial Status:** All newly created tours must have their status set to `'draft'`.
* **Constraint:** This prompt is for creating new tours only. Do not implement "edit" functionality.

## 4. Define a Strict Scope

* You should **ONLY** create or modify the following files:
    * `app/dashboard/tours/create/page.tsx`
    * `app/dashboard/tours/create/page.module.css`
    * A new component for image uploading (e.g., `components/features/TourImageUploader.tsx`).
* You will need to add a new method, `createTour()`, to `tourService.ts` and a `getAll()` method to a new `categoryService.ts`.
* Do **NOT** modify any other pages or the main dashboard layout.
