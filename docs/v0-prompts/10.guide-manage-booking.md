Create the "Manage Bookings" page for authenticated guides. This page will display a list of bookings for the guide's tours, allow filtering by status, provide actions to confirm or reject bookings, and include client-side pagination.

## 1. High-Level Goal

Build the page at the `/dashboard/bookings` route. This page must fetch all bookings associated with the authenticated guide's tours and display them in a filterable, paginated table. For any booking with a "pending" status, the guide must have "Confirm" and "Reject" actions. This functionality is a core part of the guide's operational workflow.

## 2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Create the Page File (`app/dashboard/bookings/page.tsx`):**
    * This page must be a client component (`'use client';`) to handle user interactions like filtering, pagination, and performing actions.

2.  **Implement State Management and Data Fetching:**
    * Create a state variable to hold the full list of bookings for the active filter (e.g., `allBookings`).
    * Create a state variable to hold the current status filter (e.g., `'pending'`, `'confirmed'`), defaulting to `'pending'`.
    * **Create a state variable to manage the current page number**, initialized to 1 (e.g., `currentPage`).
    * Define a page size constant (e.g., `const BOOKINGS_PER_PAGE = 10;`).
    * Use a `useEffect` hook that triggers when the status filter changes. Inside, call `bookingService.getMyBookings(status)` to fetch the relevant data and store it in `allBookings`. When the filter changes, reset `currentPage` to 1.

3.  **Implement Pagination Logic:**
    * Before rendering the table, calculate the bookings to display for the `currentPage` by slicing the `allBookings` array. For example: `allBookings.slice((currentPage - 1) * BOOKINGS_PER_PAGE, currentPage * BOOKINGS_PER_PAGE)`.
    * Render only this sliced subset of bookings in the table.

4.  **Render the Page Content:**
    * Display a main heading: `<h1>Manage Bookings</h1>`.
    * **Filter Controls:** Display tabs or buttons to filter by booking status: "Pending", "Confirmed", "Rejected", and "All".
    * **Bookings Table:** Display the paginated subset of bookings in a table with the following columns: 
        * **Tour Name:** The title of the tour that was booked.
        * **Booking Date:** The date the tourist requested.
        * **Tourist Name:** The name of the person who booked (`guest_name`).
        * **Participants:** The total number of people (`num_adults` + `num_kids`).
        * **Status:** The current booking status, shown as a styled badge.
        * **Actions:** This column is conditional:
            * If the booking status is `'pending'`, it must contain two buttons: "Confirm" and "Reject".
            * If the status is anything else, this column can be empty.
    * **Pagination Controls:** Below the table, add pagination controls.
        * "Previous" and "Next" buttons to update the `currentPage` state.
        * These buttons should be disabled when on the first or last page, respectively.
        * A page number indicator (e.g., "Page 2 of 3").

5.  **Implement Booking Actions:**
    * The "Confirm" button's `onClick` handler should call a new service function: `bookingService.updateBookingStatus(bookingId, 'confirmed')`.
    * The "Reject" button's `onClick` handler should call the same service function: `bookingService.updateBookingStatus(bookingId, 'rejected')`.
    * After a successful status update, the component should re-fetch the list of bookings for the current filter to reflect the change immediately.

## 3. Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints

* **Technology Stack:** The implementation must use Next.js (~14.2) with the App Router and be a client component.
* **Pagination:** The component will fetch all bookings for a given status filter at once and then perform pagination on the client side.
* **API Endpoints:** The page will interact with the following protected API endpoints:
    * **Fetch Bookings:** `GET /api/v1/my-bookings?status=<status>`
    * **Update Booking:** `PATCH /api/v1/bookings/{bookingId}`
* **API Request Payload:** The body for the `PATCH` request to update a booking's status is a simple JSON object:
    ```json
    { "status": "confirmed" }
    ```
    or
    ```json

    { "s
* **Data Structure:** The data returned from the `GET` endpoint will be an array of objects, for example:
    ```typescript
    interface BookingWithTourInfo {
      id: string; // Booking ID
      booking_date: string;
      guest_name: string;
      num_adults: number;
      num_kids: number;
      status: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'rejected' | 'cancelled';
      tour: {
        title: string;
      };
    }
    ```
* **Constraint:** Do not build a separate "Booking Detail" modal or page in this step.

## 4. Define a Strict Scope

* You should **ONLY** create or modify the following files:
    * `app/dashboard/bookings/page.tsx`
    * `app/dashboard/bookings/page.module.css`
* You will need to use or create the methods `getMyBookings()` and `updateBookingStatus()` in the `bookingService.ts` file.
* Do **NOT** modify the main dashboard layout or any other existing pages.
