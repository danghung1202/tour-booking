Hello v0. My goal is to provide you with the foundational context of my existing Next.js project. Please use the following information as your single source of truth for all future prompts. Your primary task is to ensure any new components or pages you create are perfectly consistent with the established style, structure, and components outlined below.

---

### 1. Core Technology Stack

The project is built with the following technologies, and all new code must adhere to this stack:
- **Framework:** Next.js ~14.2 (using the App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** CSS Modules for component-level styles and a single `globals.css` for base styles and theme variables.

---

### 2. Global Styling Foundation

All visual styling is derived from CSS custom properties (variables) defined in `globals.css`. Do not use raw hex codes for colors; always use these variables.

**`app/globals.css` Variables:**
```css
:root {
  /* Color Palette */
  --primary-color: #FF9900;
  --dark-background: #212121;
  --light-background: #FFFFFF;
  --primary-text-color: #FFFFFF;
  --secondary-text-color: #333333;

  /* Typography */
  --font-primary: 'Lora', serif;
  --font-secondary: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
}
```

-----

### 3\. Project Structure & File Conventions

All new files must be placed in the correct directory according to this structure.

**Project Structure:**

```plaintext
root/
├── app/                  # Next.js App Router
│   ├── (auth)/           # Route group for auth pages
│   ├── dashboard/        # Protected guide dashboard routes
│   └── tours/            # Public tour routes
├── components/           # Shared React components
│   ├── common/           # Complex components (Header.tsx, TourCard.tsx)
│   ├── features/         # Components for a specific feature (BookingForm.tsx)
│   └── ui/               # Basic UI primitives (Button.tsx, Input.tsx)
├── context/              # React Context providers (AuthProvider.tsx)
├── services/             # API communication layer (tourService.ts)
└── ...
```

**Naming Conventions:**

  - **Component Files:** `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `TourCard.tsx`)
  - **CSS Modules:** `ComponentName.module.css` (e.g., `TourCard.module.css`)

-----

### 4\. Key Existing Components to Reuse

My project has a library of existing components. You should always prefer reusing these components over creating new ones. Key components include:

  - `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` (used in the main layout)
  - `TourCard.tsx` (used to display a summary of a tour)
  - `Button.tsx`, `Input.tsx` (basic UI primitives)

-----

### 5\. Your First Task

To confirm you have understood this context, please create a new, simple "About Us" page.

**Request:** Create a page at `/about`. The page should use the main application layout. The text should use the secondary font (`var(--font-secondary)`). Here is a suggested content structure for the "About Us" page:

#### **5.1. Page Headline**

A compelling and mission-driven headline.
* **Headline:** Our Story: Connecting Travelers with Local Storytellers
* **Sub-headline:** We believe the best travel memories come from genuine connections and unique discoveries, not just sightseeing.

---

#### **5.2. Our Mission: Beyond the Beaten Path**

This section should explain the "why" behind the platform, directly addressing the goals outlined in the UI/UX specification.

* [cite_start]**Content:** "In a world of crowded tourist spots, we saw a need for something more authentic. Our mission is to create a trustworthy platform [cite: 3, 9, 44] [cite_start]that connects adventurous travelers with passionate local storytellers[cite: 2, 8]. [cite_start]We move beyond the ordinary to help you find unforgettable, off-the-beaten-path adventures [cite: 3, 9] that offer a true glimpse into the heart of a place."

---

#### **5.33. Our Philosophy: How We're Different**

This section can be a three-column layout with icons to break down the core values and build trust.

* **Column 1: Curated Local Experts**
    * [cite_start]"Every guide on our platform is more than just a tour operator; they are a passionate storyteller, a local expert, and a guardian of their culture[cite: 2, 8]. [cite_start]We handpick and vet every guide to ensure your experience is safe, enriching, and truly authentic[cite: 44]."

* **Column 2: Exclusively Unique Tours**
    * [cite_start]"Our platform is dedicated to niche tour offerings[cite: 2, 8]. [cite_start]We focus on the content-rich stories and unique perspectives our guides bring to life[cite: 8, 45]. You won't find generic bus tours here—only memorable experiences crafted with passion."

* **Column 3: Direct & Fair Connection**
    * "We empower local entrepreneurs by providing a direct link between you and the guide. This transparent approach ensures that the people who create and lead these amazing experiences are fairly compensated for sharing their expertise and passion."

---

#### **5.4. Meet the Founders (Optional)**

To further humanize the platform and build trust, you could include a small section with photos and brief bios of the key people behind the project.

* **Example:** "Unique Tours was founded by a small team of travelers and technologists, including Winston (our architect) and Sally (our UX expert), who believe in the power of travel to create meaningful connections."

---

#### **5.5. Call to Action**

End the page with a clear and inspiring call to action that directs the user back into the discovery funnel.

* **Headline:** Ready to Find Your Next Story?
* **Button:** Explore Our Tours
