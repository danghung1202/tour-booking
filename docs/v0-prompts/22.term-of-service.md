Create a static "Terms of Service" page. The page must clearly outline the rules, rights, and responsibilities for users (both tourists and guides) of the "Unique Tours Platform".

## 1. High-Level Goal

Build a static page at the `/terms` route. The page should function as the legal agreement between the platform and its users. The content must be well-organized with clear headings and cover key areas such as account registration, bookings, cancellations, and content ownership.

## 2. Page Content and Structure

The page should have a main heading "Terms of Service" and a "Last Updated: July 9, 2025" subheading. The body should contain the following sections with the specified placeholder content:

---

### **1. Agreement to Terms**
"These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ('you') and the Unique Tours Platform ('we', 'us', or 'our'), concerning your access to and use of the website and its services. You agree that by accessing the Site, you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all of these Terms of Service."

### **2. User Accounts**
"You may be required to register with the Site. You agree to keep your password confidential and will be responsible for all use of your account and password. We reserve the right to remove, reclaim, or change a username you select if we determine, in our sole discretion, that such username is inappropriate."
* **Tourist Role:** Users registered as 'tourists' can browse tours, make bookings, and communicate with guides.
* **Guide Role:** Users approved as 'guides' can create and manage public tour listings and manage bookings made by tourists.

### **3. Bookings and Payments**
"When you book a tour, you are entering into a direct contract with the Tour Guide. The Unique Tours Platform acts as an intermediary marketplace to facilitate this connection."
* **Cancellations and Refunds:** Cancellation policies are set by individual guides but are subject to a platform-wide minimum standard. Please review the cancellation policy listed on each tour before booking.

### **4. User-Generated Content (for Guides)**
"As a guide, you may create, post, or share content, such as text, photos, and other materials for your tour listings ('Content'). You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the Content you post. By posting Content, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, host, display, and distribute your Content to promote the platform and your tours."

### **5. Prohibited Activities**
"You may not access or use the Site for any purpose other than that for which we make the Site available. Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to: attempting to impersonate another user, harassing our employees or other users, and using any information obtained from the Site in order to harm another person."

### **6. Limitation of Liability**
"In no event will we or our directors, employees, or agents be liable to you or any third party for any direct, indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special, or punitive damages arising from your use of the site or the services provided by tour guides."

### **7. Contact Us**
"In order to resolve a complaint regarding the Site or to receive further information regarding use of the Site, please contact us at: `support@uniquetours.com`."

## 3. Define a Strict Scope

* You should ONLY create a static page at `app/terms/page.tsx`.
* The page should be a simple server component.
* Use standard HTML tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`) for structure.
* Do NOT implement any forms or dynamic functionality.
