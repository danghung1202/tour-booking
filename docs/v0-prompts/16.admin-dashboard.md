Create the secure layout for the Admin Dashboard and the "Manage Users" page. This page will allow administrators to view, search, and manage all user profiles on the platform.

## 1. High-Level Goal

Build a protected area starting at the `/admin` route, exclusively for users with the 'admin' role. Create the main layout for this section, including a dedicated sidebar for admin navigation. Within this layout, build the "Manage Users" page, which will display a paginated and searchable table of all platform users, with actions to manage their roles.

## 2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions

### Part A: Create the Admin Dashboard Layout

1.  **Create the Layout File (`app/admin/layout.tsx`):**
    * This component will wrap all pages under the `/admin` route. It must be an `async` server component.
    * **Authentication & Authorization:** It must fetch the current user's session and profile (using the `await authService.getCurrentUser()` method). If the user is not logged in, or if their `role` is NOT `'admin'`, it must redirect them to the homepage immediately.
    * **Layout Structure:** Implement a two-column layout:
        * **Left Column:** Render a new `AdminSidebar` component.
        * **Right Column:** Render the `children` prop, which will be the specific admin page.

2.  **Create the Admin Sidebar Component (`components/features/AdminSidebar.tsx`):**
    * This component serves as the primary navigation for the admin dashboard.
    * It must contain a list of navigation links:
        * **Overview:** links to `/admin`
        * **Manage Users:** links to `/admin/users`
        * **Manage Tours:** links to `/admin/tours`
        * **View All Bookings:** links to `/admin/bookings`
    * It should also include a "Logout" button that calls the `authService.logout()` function.

### Part B: Create the "Manage Users" Page

1.  **Create the Page File (`app/admin/users/page.tsx`):**
    * This page must be a client component (`'use client';`) to handle searching, pagination, and user actions.
    * It should have a main heading: `<h1>Manage Users</h1>`.

2.  **Implement Data Fetching and Filtering:**
    * Use a `useEffect` hook to fetch the list of all users from a new service function, `adminService.getUsers()`.
    * Include a search input field at the top of the page to allow admins to filter users by name or email.

3.  **Render the Users Table with Pagination:**
    * Display the fetched users in a table with columns for: User Name, Email, Role (as a styled badge), and Joined Date.
    * Implement client-side pagination for the table if the list of users is long.

4.  **Implement User Actions:**
    * Add an "Actions" column to the table.
    * For each user, include actions like "Promote to Guide" or "Change Role", which would trigger an update call to the backend.

## 3. Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints

* **Technology Stack:** The implementation must use Next.js (~14.2) with the App Router.
* **Authorization:** The admin layout **MUST** enforce the `user.role === 'admin'` check.
* **API Endpoints:** The page will interact with new, protected API endpoints that should only be accessible to admins:
    * **Fetch Users:** `GET /api/v1/admin/users` (supports search/pagination).
    * **Update a User:** `PATCH /api/v1/admin/users/{userId}` (e.g., to change their role).
* **Data Model:** The page will display an array of `Profile` objects. The `Profile` interface is as follows:
    ```typescript
    interface Profile {
      id: string; // UUID
      role: 'tourist' | 'guide' | 'admin';
      name: string;
      email: string; // This would be joined from the auth.users table
      created_at: string; // ISO 8601
    }
    ```
* **Constraint:** This prompt focuses on the layout and the "Manage Users" page only. Do not build the other admin pages yet.

## 4. Define a Strict Scope

* You should **ONLY** create or modify the following files:
    * `app/admin/layout.tsx`
    * `app/admin/users/page.tsx`
    * `app/admin/users/page.module.css`
    * `components/features/AdminSidebar.tsx`
    * `components/features/AdminSidebar.module.css`
* You will need to create a new service file, `services/adminService.ts`, with a `getUsers()` method and methods for updating users.
* Do **NOT** modify any non-admin pages or services.
