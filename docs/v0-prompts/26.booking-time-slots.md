Modify the existing `BookingForm` component to add a mandatory time slot selection. A list of predefined, hardcoded time slots should below the booking date, and the user must select one before being able to submit the form.

## 1. High-Level Goal

Update the `BookingForm.tsx` component to enhance the booking process with time selection. This is a UI-focused task to introduce time slots into the user flow. The selected time will not be saved or sent to the backend in this iteration.

## 2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Locate the Component File:**
    * Open the file at `/components/features/BookingForm.tsx`.

2.  **Add Hardcoded Time Slot Data:**
    * Inside the `BookingForm` component, define a constant array to hold the predefined time slots:
      ```javascript
      const timeSlots = ['09:00', '13:30', '17:00'];
      ```

3.  **Add State for Time Selection:**
    * Create a new `useState` variable to manage the currently selected time slot. It should be initialized as an empty string.
      ```javascript
      const [selectedTime, setSelectedTime] = useState('');
      ```

4.  **Update the UI to Include Time Slots:**
    * **Conditional Rendering:** In the JSX, add a new section for time selection that appears directly below the date input. This section is always visible regardless of whether a booking date has been selected by the user.
    * **Time Slot Buttons:** Inside this new section, map over the `timeSlots` array. For each time, render a clickable `<button>` or `<div>` that acts like a "chip".
        * The `onClick` handler for each button should update the `selectedTime` state with that time slot.
        * The currently selected time slot button should have a distinct visual style (e.g., a solid background using `--primary-color`) to indicate that it's active.

5.  **Update Form Submission Logic:**
    * Modify the main "Submit Booking Request" button to be `disabled` until both a booking date AND a time slot have been selected.
    * The `onSubmit` handler does not need to be changed, as the `selectedTime` will not be part of the data sent to the backend.

## 3. Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints

* **Technology Stack:** The implementation will be within the existing Next.js client component for the booking form.
* **UI Pattern:** It is recommended to use button-like "chips" for the time slot selection, as this is a user-friendly pattern for a small number of choices.
* **CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** This is a UI-only modification. You **MUST NOT** change the `BookingRequest` data model or the payload sent to the `bookingService`. The `selectedTime` state is for client-side validation only and should not be persisted.
* **Data Source:** The time slots are hardcoded and must be `['09:00', '13:30', '17:00']`.

## 4. Define a Strict Scope

* You should **ONLY** modify the following files:
    * `/components/features/BookingForm.tsx`
    * `/components/features/BookingForm.module.css` (to add styling for the new time slot chips).
* Do **NOT** modify any services, data models, API interfaces, or any other component.
