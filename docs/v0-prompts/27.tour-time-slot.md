Modify the "Create Tour" page to add three new mandatory sections: a multi-select for languages, a dropdown for the time zone, and an interface for guides to add, edit, and remove available time slots.

## 1. High-Level Goal

Significantly enhance the tour creation form at `/dashboard/tours/create` to capture more detailed scheduling information. This involves adding UI components for language selection, time zone selection, and time slot management, and updating the underlying data model and API payload to store this new information.

**Preamble - Required Data Model Changes:** This feature requires updating the `Tour` data model and its corresponding database table. The following new fields must be added:
* `languages: text[]` - An array of strings for the supported languages.
* `time_zone: text` - A string for the tour's primary time zone (e.g., 'Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh').
* `available_time_slots: text[]` - An array of time strings (e.g., '09:00', '13:30').

## 2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Locate and Prepare the Page File (`app/dashboard/tours/create/page.tsx`):**
    * Open the client component for the tour creation form.
    * Add new `useState` variables to manage `selectedLanguages` (an array), `selectedTimeZone` (a string), and `timeSlots` (an array).

2.  **Implement the "Languages" Section:**
    * Add a new section with a heading: "Tour Languages".
    * Provide a predefined list of common languages (e.g., `['English', 'Vietnamese', 'French', 'Japanese']`).
    * Render this list as a group of **checkboxes**. When a guide checks or unchecks a box, the language should be added to or removed from the `selectedLanguages` state array.

3.  **Implement the "Time Zone" Section:**
    * Add a new section with a heading: "Tour Time Zone".
    * Provide a predefined list of common IANA time zones (e.g., `['Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh', 'Europe/Paris', 'America/New_York']`).
    * Render this list as a **dropdown (`<select>`) menu**. The `onChange` event should update the `selectedTimeZone` state.

4.  **Implement the "Time Slots" Section:**
    * Add a new section with a heading: "Available Start Times".
    * This interface should allow a guide to **add, edit, and remove** times.
        * **Input:** An `<input type="time">` field and an "Add Time" button.
        * **Display:** Below the input, display the currently added time slots as a list of clickable "chips" or "tags".
        * **Edit:** When a guide clicks on an existing time slot chip, its value should populate the time input field, and the "Add Time" button should change to an "Update Time" button to allow for editing.
        * **Remove:** Each chip should have a small "x" icon to remove it from the list.

5.  **Update Form Submission Logic:**
    * The "Save as Draft" button should be disabled until all three new sections have valid, non-empty selections.
    * When the form is submitted, the `selectedLanguages`, `selectedTimeZone`, and `timeSlots` state must be included in the `tourData` object sent to the `tourService.createTour()` function.

## 3. Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints

* **API Request Payload Update:** The `Tour` interface and the JSON payload for the `POST /api/v1/create-tour` request must be updated to include the new fields.
    ```typescript
    interface Tour {
      // ...all other existing fields like title, price, etc.
      languages: string[]; // e.g., ["English", "Vietnamese"]
      time_zone: string; // e.g., "Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh"
      available_time_slots: string[]; // e.g., ["09:00", "13:30"]
    }
    ```
* **Mandatory Fields:** All three new fields (Languages, Time Zone, and Time Slots) are mandatory for creating a tour. The form cannot be submitted without them.
* **Constraint:** The UI for managing time slots should be intuitive, allowing for easy addition, selection for editing, and removal of times before the form is submitted.

## 4. Define a Strict Scope

* You should **ONLY** modify the following files:
    * `app/dashboard/tours/create/page.tsx`
    * `app/dashboard/tours/create/page.module.css` (for styling the new UI elements).
    * `services/tourService.ts`
    * `packages/types/index.ts`
* The `tourService.createTour()` function and the backend API endpoint for creating a tour must be updated to accept the three new fields.
* The `Tour` data model/interface definition must be updated to reflect these changes.
* Do **NOT** modify any other pages.
