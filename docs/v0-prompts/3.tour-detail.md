Create a responsive, content-rich "Tour Detail Page" using Next.js App Router, TypeScript, and CSS Modules. This page will display detailed information for a single tour and include the booking form component.

## 1. High-Level Goal

Build the page located at the `/tours/{tourId}` route. This page must fetch the complete data for a single tour from the API and display it in a clean, modern, and content-centric layout. It must render all key tour details, including a photo gallery and the rich-text "Guide's Story", and it must host the pre-existing `BookingForm` component to allow users to initiate a booking.

## 2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Create the Page File (`app/tours/[tourId]/page.tsx`):**
    * The page component must be an `async function` to fetch data on the server. It will receive `params` containing the `tourId`.
    * It should call a service function, `tourService.getById(params.tourId)`, which corresponds to the `GET /tours/{tourId}` API endpoint.
    * If no tour is found for the given ID, the page must trigger a `notFound()` state from Next.js.

2.  **Render the Page Layout and Content:**
    * **Image Gallery:** The page should prominently feature the tour's images. Use the `tour.images` array to create a gallery. Display the first image (`tour.images[0]`) as the large, primary image, with smaller thumbnails for the rest of the images below it.
    * **Main Details Section:**
        * Display the `tour.title` as the main `<h1>` heading.
        * Create a "Key Info" summary box that highlights `tour.location`, `tour.duration`, and `tour.price`.
        * Render the main `tour.description` text.
    * **Guide's Story Section:**
        * Create a distinct section with a heading like "A Story from Your Guide".
        * Render the `tour.story_html` content. **This content is rich text (HTML) and must be rendered directly to the DOM.**
    * **Booking Section:**
        * Create a section with a heading like "Book Your Adventure".
        * Import and render the `BookingForm` component, which is assumed to already exist.

3.  **Implement Responsive Design:**
    * Create a corresponding CSS Module: `app/tours/[tourId]/page.module.css`.
    * **Mobile (Default):** All sections (gallery, details, story, booking form) should be stacked vertically in a single column.
    * **Desktop (min-width: 1024px):** Use a two-column layout. The left column should contain the image gallery, main details, and the guide's story. The right column should be "sticky" and contain the `BookingForm` so it stays visible as the user scrolls through the details on the left.

## 3. Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints

* **Technology Stack:** Next.js (~14.2) App Router, TypeScript, CSS Modules.
* **API Endpoint:** The page gets its data from `GET /api/v1/tours/{tourId}`.
* **Data Model:** The page will receive and use a single `Tour` object with the structure defined in `fullstack-architecture.md`.
* **Component Dependency:** You must assume the `BookingForm` component already exists at `components/features/BookingForm.tsx` and should be imported. Do NOT recreate it.
* **Rich Text Rendering:** The `tour.story_html` field must be rendered as HTML. In React, this is typically done using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

## 4. Define a Strict Scope

* You should ONLY create or modify the following files:
    * `app/tours/[tourId]/page.tsx`
    * `app/tours/[tourId]/page.module.css`
* You will need to add the `getById` method to the `tourService.ts` file if it doesn't exist.
* Do NOT modify the `BookingForm` component or the main application layout.
