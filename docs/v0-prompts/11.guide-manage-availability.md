Create the "Manage Availability" page for authenticated guides. This page will feature a tour selector and a calendar interface to allow guides to mark specific dates as unavailable for booking.

## 1. High-Level Goal

Build the page at the `/dashboard/availability` route. This page must allow a guide to first select one of their tours from a dropdown menu. Once a tour is selected, the page will display a calendar showing the currently unavailable dates for that tour. The guide must be able to click on any date to toggle its status between "available" and "unavailable".

## 2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Create the Page File (`app/dashboard/availability/page.tsx`):**
    * This page must be a client component (`'use client';`) to handle the state and interactivity of the tour selector and calendar.
    * It will render inside the `DashboardLayout`, so it can assume a guide is authenticated.

2.  **Implement Tour Selection:**
    * On page load, use the existing `tourService.getMyTours()` function to fetch a list of the guide's tours.
    * Create a state variable to hold the `selectedTourId`.
    * Render a `<select>` dropdown menu populated with the guide's tours. When the guide selects a tour, update the `selectedTourId` state.

3.  **Implement Calendar and Availability Display:**
    * When the `selectedTourId` changes, trigger a `useEffect` hook to fetch the availability data for that tour.
    * Create a new service, `availabilityService.ts`, with a function `getUnavailableDates(tourId)`. This function will fetch the list of currently blocked dates for the selected tour.
    * Render a calendar component (a lightweight library like `react-calendar` is acceptable, or a custom-built one).
    * In the calendar, visually highlight the dates that are returned from the service as "unavailable" (e.g., give them a different background color or a strikethrough).

4.  **Implement Date Toggling Logic:**
    * When a guide clicks a date on the calendar, the `onClick` handler must perform a toggle action:
    * **If the date is currently available:** Call a new service function, `availabilityService.addUnavailableDate(tourId, date)`, to block the date.
    * **If the date is currently unavailable:** Call another new service function, `availabilityService.removeUnavailableDate(tourId, date)`, to make it available again.
    * After the service call is successful, the availability data must be re-fetched to update the calendar view instantly.

## 3. Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints

* **Technology Stack:** The implementation must use Next.js (~14.2) with the App Router and be a client component.
* **API Endpoints:** The page will interact with the following new, protected API endpoints:
    * **Fetch unavailable dates:** `GET /api/v1/tours/{tourId}/availability` (returns an array of date strings, e.g., `["2025-08-10", "2025-08-11"]`).
    * **Block a date:** `POST /api/v1/tours/{tourId}/availability` (with a request body of `{ "date": "YYYY-MM-DD" }`).
    * **Unblock a date:** `DELETE /api/v1/tours/{tourId}/availability` (with a request body of `{ "date": "YYYY-MM-DD" }`).
* **Data Models:** The page logic is based on the `Tour` and `TourAvailability` data models. The `TourAvailability` table links a `tour_id` to an `unavailable_date`.
* **Constraint:** The calendar interaction should be simple. The guide should toggle one date at a time. Do not implement complex date-range selection.

## 4. Define a Strict Scope

* You should **ONLY** create or modify the following files:
    * `app/dashboard/availability/page.tsx`
    * `app/dashboard/availability/page.module.css`
* You will need to create a new service file, `services/availabilityService.ts`, with the methods `getUnavailableDates()`, `addUnavailableDate()`, and `removeUnavailableDate()`.
* Do **NOT** modify the main dashboard layout or any other existing pages.
