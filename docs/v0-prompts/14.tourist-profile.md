Create the "Profile" page for authenticated tourists. This page will allow a user to update their personal information (name, phone) and to change their password.

## 1. High-Level Goal

Build a protected page at a route like `/profile`. This page must fetch the current tourist's profile data, display it in a form, and allow them to update their information. It must also include a separate, secure form for changing their account password using the Supabase client SDK.

## 2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Create the Page File (`app/profile/page.tsx`):**
    * This page must be a client component (`'use client';`) to handle form state and user interactions.
    * It must be a protected route, redirecting unauthenticated users to `/login`.

2.  **Data Fetching and State Management:**
    * Use a `useEffect` hook to fetch the tourist's current profile data on page load using the `profileService.getMyProfile()` function.
    * Use `useState` to manage the form fields, initializing the state with the fetched profile data.

3.  **Render the Profile Form:**
    * The page should have a main heading: `<h1>My Profile</h1>`.
    * **Profile Information Section:**
        * Display the user's email address as non-editable text.
        * Create form inputs for the `name` and `phone` fields.
        * Add an "Update Profile" button. Its `onClick` handler should call the `profileService.updateMyProfile()` function, passing the current form state.
    * **Change Password Section:**
        * Create a distinct section with a heading like "Change Password".
        * Include an input field for "New Password" and another for "Confirm New Password".
        * Add a "Change Password" button. Its `onClick` handler must first verify that the two password fields match. If they do, it should call a new service function, `authService.updatePassword(newPassword)`.

4.  **Implement Feedback:**
    * Upon successful completion of either action (updating the profile or changing the password), display a clear success message or a toast notification to the user.

## 3. Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints

* **Technology Stack:** The implementation must use Next.js (~14.2) with the App Router and be a client component.
* **API Endpoints:** The page will interact with the following protected API endpoints for profile data:
    * **Fetch Profile:** `GET /api/v1/my-profile`
    * **Update Profile:** `PATCH /api/v1/my-profile`
* **API Request Payload:** The body for the `PATCH` request will be a partial `Profile` object (e.g., `{ "name": "New Name" }`).
* **Password Update Method:** Changing the password must be handled on the client-side by calling the Supabase SDK method: `supabase.auth.updateUser({ password: newPassword })`.
* **Data Model:** The form fields correspond to the `name` and `phone` fields of the `Profile` data model.

## 4. Define a Strict Scope

* You should **ONLY** create or modify the following files:
    * `app/profile/page.tsx`
    * `app/profile/page.module.css`
* You will use the existing `profileService.ts`.
* You will need to add a new method, `updatePassword()`, to the `authService.ts` file.
* Do **NOT** modify any other pages or layouts.
