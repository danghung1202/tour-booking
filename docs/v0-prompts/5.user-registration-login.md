Create a responsive page for user registration and login using Next.js App Router, TypeScript, and the Supabase client library.

## 1. High-Level Goal

The objective is to build a single page at the `/login` route that contains two distinct forms: one for user registration and one for user login. The user must be able to easily toggle between these two forms. The component must use the Supabase JS library for authentication and call the backend API for registration, as specified in the architecture documents.

## 2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Create the Page File (`app/login/page.tsx`):**
    * This page will manage the state to switch between the 'login' and 'register' views (e.g., using `useState`).
    * It will conditionally render either the `LoginForm` or `RegisterForm` component based on the current state.
    * It must include a link or button to allow users to toggle between the two modes (e.g., "Don't have an account? Sign Up").

2.  **Create the Registration Form Component (`components/features/RegisterForm.tsx`):**
    * The form should have two fields: "Email" and "Password".
    * Include client-side validation for a valid email format and a minimum password length.
    * The form's submit handler should call an `authService.register` function.
    * Upon successful registration, the user should be automatically logged in and redirected to the homepage[cite: 99].

3.  **Create the Login Form Component (`components/features/LoginForm.tsx`):**
    * The form should have two fields: "Email" and "Password".
    * The form's submit handler should call an `authService.login` function.
    * Upon successful login, redirect the user to the homepage.

4.  **Create the Authentication Service (`services/authService.ts`):**
    * This service will encapsulate all authentication logic.
    * **`register` function:** This function should accept an email and password, and make a `POST` request to the `/api/v1/auth/register` endpoint defined in the API spec.
    * **`login` function:** This function should accept an email and password and use the Supabase client library's `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()` method to authenticate the user.
    * **`logout` function:** Create a `logout` function that calls `supabase.auth.signOut()`. This will be used later in the main site header.

5.  **Styling:**
    * Create corresponding CSS Modules for the form components.
    * The forms should be presented cleanly in the center of the page, on a simple, uncluttered background.

## 3. Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints

* **Technology Stack:** Next.js (~14.2), TypeScript, Supabase Auth.
* **Registration Endpoint:** The `register` service must call `POST /api/v1/auth/register`.
* **Registration Payload:** The request body should be `{ email: "string", password: "string" }`.
* **Login Method:** Login must be handled client-side using the `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()` function from the official Supabase library.
* **User Role Constraint:** Upon successful registration, a corresponding entry is created in the `profiles` table with the default role of 'tourist'. (Note: This is a backend behavior, but the frontend flow should lead to this outcome). This is the interface for `profiles` table:
    ```typescript
        interface Profile {
        id: string; // UUID
        role: 'tourist' | 'guide' | 'admin';
        name: string;
        bio?: string;
        phone?: string;
        photo_url?: string;
        created_at: string; // ISO 8601
        updated_at: string;
        }
    ```

## 4. Define a Strict Scope

* You should ONLY create or modify the following files:
    * `app/login/page.tsx`
    * `components/features/RegisterForm.tsx`
    * `components/features/RegisterForm.module.css`
    * `components/features/LoginForm.tsx`
    * `components/features/LoginForm.module.css`
    * `services/authService.ts`
* Do NOT modify any other pages, the main layout, or other services.
