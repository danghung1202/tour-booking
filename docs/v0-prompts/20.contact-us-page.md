Create a "Contact Us" page. The page will provide users with multiple ways to get in touch, including a contact form, direct email, and a physical office address.
 
## 1. High-Level Goal
 
Build a static page at the `/contact` route. The page should be clean, professional, and provide clear information for users who need to contact the support team. It will feature a two-column layout: a contact form on one side, and a block with static contact details and a map on the other.
 
## 2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions
 
1.  **Create the Page File (`app/contact/page.tsx`):**
    * This page should be a client component (`'use client';`) to handle the contact form's state and submission.
    * It should use the main application layout (Header and Footer).
 
2.  **Implement the Two-Column Layout:**
    * The page content should be split into two columns that stack vertically on mobile screens.
    * **Left Column:** This column will contain the contact form.
    * **Right Column:** This column will contain the static contact information block.
 
3.  **Build the Contact Form (Left Column):**
    * Add a heading: "Send Us a Message".
    * Create a form with the following fields:
        * `name` (text input, required)
        * `email` (email input, required)
        * `subject` (text input)
        * `message` (textarea, required)
    * Add a "Submit" button styled with the primary action color (`--primary-color`).
    * On successful form submission, hide the form and display a success message like: "Thank you for your message! We'll get back to you shortly."
 
4.  **Build the Static Information Block (Right Column):**
    * Add a heading: "Contact Information".
    * Display the following static details:
        * **Email:** "For general inquiries, email us at `support@uniquetours.com`."
        * **Address:** "Our Office: 123 Travel Lane, Hoan Kiem District, Hanoi, Vietnam."
        * **Business Hours:** "Monday – Friday, 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM (+07)."
    * **Map Placeholder:** Below the text details, include a simple placeholder for a map. This can be a static image of a map or a gray box with "Map" written in the center, indicating where an interactive map would be embedded.
 
## 3. Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints
 
* **Technology Stack:** The implementation must use Next.js (~14.2) with the App Router and be a client component.
* **API Endpoint:** The contact form submission should make a `POST` request to a new, non-protected API endpoint, for example: `/api/v1/contact`.
* **API Request Payload:** The body for the `POST` request should be a simple JSON object containing the form data:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
      "subject": "Question about a tour",
      "message": "I have a question about the 'Hanoi Street Food Discovery' tour..."
    }
    ```
* **Constraint:** This is a simple contact form. Do not implement complex validation or file attachments.
 
## 4. Define a Strict Scope
 
* You should **ONLY** create or modify the following files:
    * `app/contact/page.tsx`
    * `app/contact/page.module.css`
* You will need to define the logic for submitting the contact form, which might involve creating a new service file or adding a method to an existing one.
* Do **NOT** modify the main application layout or any other existing pages.
