Create a protected route and layout for the Tour Guide Dashboard using Next.js App Router, TypeScript, and Supabase for authentication.

## 1. High-Level Goal

The goal is to build the main layout and entry page for the authenticated Tour Guide Dashboard. This involves creating a protected route at `/dashboard` that verifies the user is not only logged in but also has the 'guide' role. The layout must include a persistent sidebar with navigation to all guide-specific pages.

## 2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Create the Dashboard Layout (`app/dashboard/layout.tsx`):**
    * This component must be an `async` server component to perform session checks.
    * **Authentication & Authorization:**
        * Get the current user session from Supabase. If there is no session, redirect the user to the `/login` page.
        * Fetch the user's profile to get their `role`. If the `role` is NOT `'guide'`, redirect the user to the homepage.
    * **Layout Structure:** Implement a two-column layout.
        * **Left Column:** Render the `DashboardSidebar` component.
        * **Right Column:** Render the `children` prop. This area will display the content of the specific dashboard page being viewed.

2.  **Create the Dashboard Sidebar (`components/features/DashboardSidebar.tsx`):**
    * This component is the primary navigation for the guide.
    * **User Info:** Display the logged-in guide's name and a "Logout" button. The logout button must call the `authService.logout()` function.
    * [cite_start]**Navigation Links:** It must contain a list of navigation links as specified in the UI/UX spec[cite: 52]:
        * **Overview:** links to `/dashboard`
        * **My Tours:** links to `/dashboard/tours`
        * **Manage Bookings:** links to `/dashboard/bookings`
        * **Manage Availability:** links to `/dashboard/availability`
        * **Profile:** links to `/dashboard/profile`
    * The link for the currently active page should have a distinct visual style.

3.  **Create the Default Dashboard Page (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`):**
    * This will be the "Overview" page and the default landing page for `/dashboard`.
    * For this initial prompt, it can be a simple placeholder. It should contain a heading like `<h1>Dashboard Overview</h1>` and some welcome text for the guide.

## 3. Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints

* **Technology Stack:** Next.js (~14.2) App Router, TypeScript, Supabase Auth.
* **Authorization Logic:** The layout MUST enforce role-based access. The core logic is: `if (user.role !== 'guide') { redirect('/') }`. This check relies on the `role` field from the `Profile` data model.
* **Component Dependency:** The sidebar must import and use the `authService.logout()` function, which is assumed to exist in `services/authService.ts`.
* **Constraint:** This prompt is for creating the dashboard *shell* and *layout*. Do NOT build the full functionality for the "My Tours" or "Manage Bookings" pages. They will be handled in separate, subsequent prompts.

## 4. Define a Strict Scope

* You should ONLY create or modify the following files:
    * `app/dashboard/layout.tsx`
    * `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
    * `components/features/DashboardSidebar.tsx`
    * `components/features/DashboardSidebar.module.css`
* Do NOT modify any public-facing pages, the main application layout (`app/layout.tsx`), or other services.
