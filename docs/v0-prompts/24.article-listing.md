Create an "Article Listing Page". This page will serve as the main index for all articles, fetching a list of all available articles from the mock CMS and displaying them as a grid of summary cards.

## 1. High-Level Goal

Build a page at the `/articles` route that functions as a blog index. The page will fetch all article data from the local mock CMS file (`/lib/articles.ts`), sort them by date to show the most recent first, and display each article as a clickable card that leads to the full article page.

## 2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Create the Page File (`app/articles/page.tsx`):**
    * This page should be a simple server component, as it can fetch and render all the data server-side.
    * It should have a main heading like "Our Guides & Stories" and a brief, welcoming subheading.

2.  **Data Fetching and Sorting:**
    * Import the articles array from the mock CMS file located at `lib/articles.ts`.
    * Sort the array of articles in reverse chronological order to ensure the newest articles appear at the top of the list.

3.  **Create a Reusable `ArticleCard` Component (`components/features/ArticleCard.tsx`):**
    * This new component will be used to display a summary of a single article in the list.
    * It should accept a single article object as a prop.
    * The card should display the following information from the article object:
        * The `headerImageUrl` as a banner image.
        * The `title` of the article.
        * The `date` it was published.
    * The entire `ArticleCard` must be wrapped in a Next.js `<Link>` component that navigates to the full article page (e.g., `/articles/[article.slug]`).

4.  **Render the Page Content:**
    * In the main `app/articles/page.tsx` file, map over the sorted array of articles.
    * For each `article` object, render the new `ArticleCard` component, passing the `article` data as a prop.
    * The cards should be displayed in a responsive grid that shows 1-2 columns on mobile and 3 columns on desktop.

## 3. Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints

* **Technology Stack:** The implementation must use Next.js (~14.2) with the App Router and be a server component.
* **Data Source:** The data for this page comes **directly** from the static array defined in the `lib/articles.ts` file. No API calls are necessary for this page.
* **Data Structure:** The `ArticleCard` component will receive a prop conforming to the following interface:
    ```typescript
    interface Article {
      slug: string;
      title: string;
      author: string;
      date: string;
      headerImageUrl: string;
      content: React.ReactNode; // Or JSX.Element
    }
    ```
* **Constraint:** For the MVP, this page will display all articles on a single page. Do not implement pagination.

## 4. Define a Strict Scope

* You should **ONLY** create or modify the following files:
    * `app/articles/page.tsx`
    * `app/articles/page.module.css`
    * `components/features/ArticleCard.tsx` (new file)
    * `components/features/ArticleCard.module.css` (new file)
* Do **NOT** modify the individual article template (`app/articles/[slug]/page.tsx`), the mock CMS data, or any other part of the application.
