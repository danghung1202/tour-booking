Create a responsive "Tour Card" component using Next.js, TypeScript, and CSS Modules that displays a summary of a tour.

## 1. High-Level Goal

Generate a reusable React component named `TourCard` that accepts a `Tour` object as a prop and displays its key information, including an image, title, location, duration, and price. The component must match the project's visual style and use the official shared `Tour` type.

## 2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Create the Component File (`apps/web/components/common/TourCard.tsx`):**
    * The component must be a functional component using TypeScript.
    * It should import the `Tour` interface from the shared types package (`packages/types`).
    * It should accept a single prop: `{ tour: Tour }`.

2.  **Structure the Card:**
    * The root element should be a `<Link>` component from `next/link` that navigates to `/tours/[tour.id]`.
    * Use the first image from the `tour.images` array for the main display. The `next/image` component should display `tour.images[0]`.
    * Display the `tour.title` prominently.
    * Display other key details like `tour.location` and `tour.duration`.
    * Display the `tour.price` formatted as currency (e.g., "From $150").

3.  **Create the Styling (`apps/web/components/common/TourCard.module.css`):**
    * The main card container (`.card`) should have a light background (`var(--light-background)`) and a subtle box-shadow.
    * The card should have a hover effect to indicate it is clickable.

## 3. Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints

* **Technology Stack:** Next.js (~14.2), React (~18.3), TypeScript, CSS Modules.
* **Component Prop:** The component MUST accept a single prop `tour` of type `Tour`.
    ```typescript
    import { Tour } from '@/packages/types'; // Assuming path to shared types

    type TourCardProps = {
      tour: Tour;
    };
    ```
* **Data Model Reference (`Tour` interface):** The component must use fields from the official `Tour` model, such as `id`, `title`, `price`, `location`, `duration`, and `images` (which is a `string[]`).
* **Constraint:** Use the `next/image` component for images and `next/link` for navigation.

## 4. Define a Strict Scope

* You should ONLY create or modify the following files:
    * `apps/web/components/common/TourCard.tsx`
    * `apps/web/components/common/TourCard.module.css`
* Do NOT alter the layout or any other existing component.
