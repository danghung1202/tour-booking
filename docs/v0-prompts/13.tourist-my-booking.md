Create the "My Bookings" page for authenticated tourists. This page will display a list of the user's past and upcoming bookings and provide an action to cancel them.

## 1. High-Level Goal

Build a protected page at the `/my-bookings` route. This page must fetch and display a list of all bookings made by the currently logged-in tourist. The list should be presented in a user-friendly way, showing the status of each booking. For upcoming bookings, the user must have the option to cancel.

## 2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Create the Page File (`app/my-bookings/page.tsx`):**
    * This page must be a protected route. The component should be an `async` server component that checks for a user session and redirects to `/login` if the user is not authenticated.
    * It should have a main heading like `<h1>My Bookings</h1>`.

2.  **Data Fetching:**
    * On page load, the component should call a new service function, `bookingService.getTouristBookings()`.
    * This function will call a new protected API endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/v1/my-bookings`) that returns an array of the user's `Booking` objects, including relevant information from the associated `Tour`.
    * **Empty State:** If the user has no bookings, the page should display a message encouraging them to explore and book a tour, with a link to the main tours page.

3.  **Render the Bookings List:**
    * Display the fetched bookings as a list of "Booking Cards". This is more user-friendly for a customer-facing page than a dense table.
    * Each **Booking Card** should display:
        * A primary image from the tour.
        * The tour's title.
        * The date the user booked for (`booking_date`).
        * The number of participants.
        * The booking `status` ("Pending", "Confirmed", "Cancelled"), displayed as a visually distinct badge.

4.  **Implement Cancellation Logic:**
    * On each Booking Card where the status is "Pending" or "Confirmed", display a "Cancel Booking" button.
    * When a user clicks "Cancel Booking", it should first open a confirmation modal asking, "Are you sure you want to cancel this booking?".
    * If the user confirms, call a new service function `bookingService.cancelMyBooking(bookingId)`.
    * This function will make a `PATCH` request to a new protected endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/my-bookings/{bookingId}/cancel`).
    * After a successful cancellation, the list should update to show the new "Cancelled" status for that booking.

## 3. Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints

* **Technology Stack:** The implementation must use Next.js (~14.2) with the App Router. The page itself can be a server component, but the cancellation logic will require a client component for the buttons and modal.
* **API Endpoints:** The page will interact with the following new, protected API endpoints:
    * **Fetch Bookings:** `GET /api/v1/my-bookings`
    * **Cancel a Booking:** `PATCH /api/v1/my-bookings/{bookingId}/cancel`
* **Data Structure:** The data returned from the `GET` endpoint will be an array of objects containing booking and tour information. For example:
    ```typescript
    interface TouristBooking {
      id: string; // Booking ID
      booking_date: string;
      status: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'rejected' | 'cancelled';
      num_adults: number;
      num_kids: number;
      tour: {
        id: string; // Tour ID
        title: string;
        images: string[];
      };
    }
    ```
* **Constraint:** The "Cancel Booking" option should not be visible for bookings that are already cancelled or have been rejected by a guide.

## 4. Define a Strict Scope

* You should **ONLY** create or modify the following files:
    * `app/my-bookings/page.tsx`
    * `app/my-bookings/page.module.css`
    * A new client component for the "Booking Card" and its cancellation logic might be necessary.
* You will need to add new methods, `getTouristBookings()` and `cancelMyBooking()`, to the `bookingService.ts` file.
* Do **NOT** modify the main application layout or any other existing pages.
