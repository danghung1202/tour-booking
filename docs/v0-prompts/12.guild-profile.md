Create the "Profile" page within the Guide Dashboard. This page will allow an authenticated guide to view and update their public profile information, including their name, bio, phone number, and profile picture.

## 1. High-Level Goal

Build the page at the `/dashboard/profile` route. This page must fetch the current guide's profile data, display it in a form, and allow the guide to update their information. This includes handling a profile picture upload directly to Supabase Storage and saving the updated text fields to the database via an API call.

## 2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Create the Page File (`app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx`):**
    * This page must be a client component (`'use client';`) to manage the form state and user interactions.
    * It will render inside the `DashboardLayout`, so it can assume a guide is authenticated.

2.  **Data Fetching and State Management:**
    * Use a `useEffect` hook to fetch the guide's current profile data on page load. This will require a new service function, `profileService.getMyProfile()`.
    * Use `useState` to manage the form fields, initializing the state with the fetched profile data.

3.  **Render the Profile Form:**
    * The page should have a main heading: `<h1>My Profile</h1>`.
    * **Profile Picture Section:**
        * Display the current profile picture using the `photo_url` from the profile data.
        * Add a "Change Picture" button. When clicked, it should open a file input dialog.
        * When a new image is selected, it must be uploaded directly to a "profile-photos" bucket in Supabase Storage.
        * After a successful upload, the new image URL returned from storage should update the `photo_url` in the component's state.
    * **Text Fields:** Create form inputs for the following editable fields from the `Profile` data model:
        * `name` (text input)
        * `phone` (text input)
        * `bio` (textarea for a longer description)

4.  **Implement Form Submission:**
    * Add an "Update Profile" button at the end of the form.
    * The button's `onClick` handler should call a new service function, `profileService.updateMyProfile(profileData)`, passing the current state of the form.
    * After the update is successful, display a success message to the user (e.g., a simple text message or a toast notification).

## 3. Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints

* **Technology Stack:** The implementation must use Next.js (~14.2) with the App Router and be a client component.
* **API Endpoints:** The page will interact with the following new, protected API endpoints:
    * **Fetch Profile:** `GET /api/v1/my-profile`
    * **Update Profile:** `PATCH /api/v1/my-profile`
* **API Request Payload:** The body for the `PATCH` request will be a partial `Profile` object containing only the fields that were changed. For example:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "A New Name",
      "bio": "An updated bio.",
      "photo_url": "https://<...>/new-photo.jpg"
    }
    ```
* **File Uploads:** The profile photo **MUST** be uploaded on the client-side directly to Supabase Storage. The backend API only receives the final URL string for the `photo_url` field.
* **Data Model:** The form fields directly correspond to the editable fields of the `Profile` data model: `name`, `phone`, `bio`, and `photo_url`.

## 4. Define a Strict Scope

* You should **ONLY** create or modify the following files:
    * `app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx`
    * `app/dashboard/profile/page.module.css`
* You will need to create a new service file, `services/profileService.ts`, with the methods `getMyProfile()` and `updateMyProfile()`.
* Do **NOT** modify the main dashboard layout or any other existing pages.
