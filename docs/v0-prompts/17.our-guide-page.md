Create the "Our Guides" page, a public-facing gallery that showcases all of the platform's tour guides and the tours they offer.

## 1. High-Level Goal

Build the page at the `/guides` route. This page will fetch and display a list of all approved guides on the platform. Each guide's profile will be presented in a detailed card, including their photo, bio, and a list of the tours they lead. The purpose of this page is to build user trust and help users connect with the storytellers behind the tours.

## 2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Create the Page File (`app/guides/page.tsx`):**
    * This page must be an `async` server component, as it will fetch its content on the server.
    * It should have a main heading like "Meet Our Local Experts" and a brief introductory paragraph about the quality and passion of the guides.

2.  **Implement Data Fetching:**
    * At the top of the component, call a new service function, `guideService.getAllGuidesWithTours()`.
    * This function will call a new public API endpoint (e.g., `GET /api/v1/guides`) that returns an array of guide profiles. Crucially, each guide profile object in the array should also contain a nested array of their published tours.

3.  **Create a `GuideProfileCard` Component (`components/features/GuideProfileCard.tsx`):**
    * This will be a new, dedicated component to display a single guide's full profile.
    * The card should be well-structured, possibly with a two-column layout on larger screens.
        * **Profile Section:** Display the guide's `photo_url` as a large, high-quality image. Also, display their `name` and their full `bio`.
        * **Tours Section:** Display a subheading like "Tours by [Guide's Name]". Below this, map over the guide's `tours` array and render a `TourCard` component for each tour.

4.  **Render the Page Content:**
    * In the main `guides/page.tsx` file, map over the array of guides fetched in step 2.
    * For each `guide` object, render the new `GuideProfileCard` component, passing the guide data as a prop.

## 3. Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints

* **Technology Stack:** The implementation must use Next.js (~14.2) with the App Router and be an `async` server component.
* **Component Dependency:** The new `GuideProfileCard` component will import and use the existing `TourCard` component.
* **API Endpoint:** The page will consume data from a new public API endpoint: `GET /api/v1/guides`.
* **Data Structure:** The data returned from the API for each guide must be a nested object containing the guide's profile and an array of their tours. For example:
    ```typescript
    // A simplified Tour object for the nested list
    interface TourSnippet {
      id: string;
      title: string;
      images: string[];
    }

    // The main object for each guide
    interface GuideWithTours {
      id: string;
      name: string;
      bio: string;
      photo_url: string;
      tours: TourSnippet[];
    }
    ```
* **Constraint:** The page should only display guides with the `'guide'` role and only list tours with a `'published'` status. This filtering logic should be handled by the backend API.

## 4. Define a Strict Scope

* You should **ONLY** create or modify the following files:
    * `app/guides/page.tsx`
    * `app/guides/page.module.css`
    * `components/features/GuideProfileCard.tsx`
    * `components/features/GuideProfileCard.module.css`
* You will need to create a new service file, `services/guideService.ts`, with a `getAllGuidesWithTours()` method.
* Do **NOT** modify any dashboard or protected pages.
