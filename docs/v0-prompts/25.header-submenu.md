Modify the main site `Header` to use a reusable, data-driven dropdown component for static navigation menus. The link data should be defined in the `Header` and passed as props to a generic dropdown component, which will be used to create a "More" menu.

## 1. High-Level Goal

Improve the component architecture by creating a generic and reusable `DropdownMenu` component. Modify the `Header.tsx` component to define a list of static links as a data array. This array will be passed as a prop to the new dropdown component to render the "More" menu, grouping links like "About Us" and "Contact Us".

## 2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Create a Generic, Reusable `DropdownMenu` Component:**
    * Create a new file for the component at `/components/common/DropdownMenu.tsx`.
    * This component must be a client component (`'use client';`) to handle hover interactions.
    * It must accept two props: `title` (a string) and `items` (an array of link objects).
    * **Props Interface:**
        ```typescript
        interface NavItem {
          href: string;
          label: string;
        }

        interface DropdownMenuProps {
          title: string;
          items: NavItem[];
        }
        ```
    * The component will use the `title` prop as the visible text in the header.
    * On hover, it will render a dropdown menu by mapping over the `items` array and creating a `<Link>` for each item with its `label` and `href`.

2.  **Update the Main `Header.tsx` Component:**
    * Open the file at `/components/common/Header.tsx`.
    * **Remove Old Links:** In the main navigation bar, remove the individual, separate links for "About Us" and "Contact Us"
    * **Define the Menu Data:** Inside the `Header` component, define a constant array with the data for the "More" menu. This keeps the data management within the `Header`.
        ```typescript
        const moreMenuItems = [
          { href: '/about', label: 'About Us' },
          { href: '/contact', label: 'Contact Us' },
          // A divider can be handled with a special item or CSS
          { href: '/privacy-policy', label: 'Privacy Policy' },
          { href: '/terms', label: 'Terms of Service' },
        ];
        ```
    * **Render the Dropdown:** In place of the removed links, render the new `<DropdownMenu />` component. Pass the title and the data array as props:
        ```jsx
        <DropdownMenu title="More" items={moreMenuItems} />
        ```

## 3. Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints

* **Technology Stack:** The implementation must use Next.js (~14.2) with the App Router and client components for the dropdown.
* **Data Flow:** The `Header` component is now the source of truth for the menu's content. The `DropdownMenu` component is purely for presentation and has no knowledge of what it is displaying.
* **Reusability:** This new `DropdownMenu` component can be used anywhere in the application to create a dropdown menu by simply providing a different title and array of items.
* **Constraint:** The styling of the new `DropdownMenu` must be consistent with the existing header design.

## 4. Define a Strict Scope

* You should **ONLY** modify or create the following files:
    * `/components/common/Header.tsx`
    * `/components/common/DropdownMenu.tsx` (new file)
    * `/components/common/DropdownMenu.module.css` (new file)
* Do **NOT** modify any other pages or services.
