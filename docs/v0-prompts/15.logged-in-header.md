Modify the main site `Header` component to make it dynamic. It should show a "Login/Register" button for guests and a user-specific dropdown menu for authenticated users, with navigation links appropriate to their role ('tourist' or 'guide').

## 1. High-Level Goal

Update the primary `Header.tsx` component to be aware of the user's authentication status. For logged-in users, replace the static "Login / Register" button with a dropdown menu. This menu will display the user's name and provide navigation links to protected pages based on the user's role, as well as a logout option.

## 2. Detailed, Step-by-Step Instructions

1.  **Update `Header.tsx` to be a Client Component:**
    * Open the file at `components/common/Header.tsx`.
    * Add the `'use client';` directive at the top of the file.

2.  **Access Authentication State:**
    * Inside the `Header` component, use the `await authService.getCurrentUser()` method (from `authService`) to get the current `user` object.

3.  **Implement Conditional Rendering in the Header:**
    * Modify the component's return statement to implement conditional logic:
    * **If a `user` object exists:** Render a new `UserMenu` component. Pass the `user` object as a prop to it.
    * **If the `user` object is `null` (guest):** Continue to render the existing "Login / Register" button.

4.  **Create the `UserMenu` Dropdown Component (`components/common/UserMenu.tsx`):**
    * This new component will receive the `user` object as a prop.
    * The visible part of the component should be a button that displays the user's name and has a dropdown icon.
    * When this button is clicked, a dropdown menu should appear with the following items, rendered conditionally based on the user's role:
        * **For `'guide'` role:**
            * A link to "Dashboard" pointing to `/dashboard`.
            * A link to "My Profile" pointing to `/dashboard/profile`.
        * **For `'tourist'` role:**
            * A link to "My Bookings" pointing to `/my-bookings`.
            * A link to "My Profile" pointing to `/profile`.
        * **For all roles:**
            * A "Logout" button. This button's `onClick` handler must call the `authService.logout()` function and then redirect the user to the homepage.

## 3. Code Examples, Data Structures & Constraints

* **Technology Stack:** The implementation must use Next.js (~14.2) with the App Router and be a client component.
* **Data Model:** The logic is driven by the `user` object obtained from the `authService.getCurrentUser()` method. This object is expected to contain a `role` property with a value of either `'guide'` or `'tourist'`.
    ```typescript
    // Expected structure of the user object
    interface User {
      id: string;
      name: string;
      email: string;
      role: 'guide' | 'tourist' | 'admin';
    }
    ```
* **Dependencies:** The component assumes the `authService.getCurrentUser()` method and the `authService.logout()` function are already implemented and available for use.
* **Constraint:** The dropdown should be styled cleanly to fit the existing header design. It should be accessible and close when the user clicks outside of it.

## 4. Define a Strict Scope

* You should **ONLY** modify or create the following files:
    * `components/common/Header.tsx`
    * `components/common/UserMenu.tsx` (new file)
    * `components/common/UserMenu.module.css` (new file)
* Do **NOT** modify any page content or the implementation of the auth services or context, only use them.
