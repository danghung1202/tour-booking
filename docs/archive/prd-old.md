# Unique Tours Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.2
**Date:** May 28, 2025

## Goal, Objective and Context

**Goal:**
To be the leading online platform for discovering and booking unique, authentic, and offbeat tour experiences worldwide, empowering local guides to share their passions and enabling travelers to create unforgettable memories beyond the mainstream.

**Objective (MVP Focus):**
* Successfully develop and deploy the "Unique Tours Platform" MVP with core functionalities for Tourists (browse, filter by category, book, cancel bookings, contact guides), Tour Guides (create/manage tours with categories and availability, manage bookings including cancellations, "Guide's Story"), and Admin (user/tour management, initial category setup, simple dashboard) within the 1-week development timeframe.
* Onboard at least 5-10 tour guides who collectively list a minimum of 10-15 unique, offbeat tours on the platform within the first week of its operational launch.
* Achieve at least 5-10 successful tour bookings through the platform within the first two weeks following the operational launch.
* Collect initial feedback from at least 3-5 early adopter tour guides and 5-10 early adopter tourists within one month of launch to identify key pain points and priority improvements.

**Context:**
The current tourism market is dominated by large booking platforms that tend to prioritize mainstream, high-volume tours. This makes it challenging for tourists to discover unique, offbeat, and authentic local experiences that go beyond standard itineraries. Simultaneously, many local tour guides who offer these specialized and personalized tours struggle to gain visibility and effectively manage bookings through platforms that are not tailored to their niche offerings. Unique Tours Platform aims to address this gap by providing a dedicated online marketplace that connects discerning tourists with local guides offering unique and unconventional tour experiences. The platform will provide tools for guides to easily create, promote, and manage their specialized tours, including features that allow them to share rich narratives and highlight the distinctiveness of their offerings. For tourists, it will serve as a trusted source for finding and booking memorable, off-the-beaten-path adventures that are not easily accessible through mainstream channels. This project is needed to bridge the gap between providers of unique tours and travelers seeking more authentic and personalized experiences.

**Branding Considerations (High-Level):**
* Platform Name: "Unique Tours Platform".
* Core Message: Emphasis on "unique, offbeat, authentic local experiences"[cite: 104, 219].
* Visual Style: Clean, minimalist, and modern, inspired by `atasteofhanoi.com`[cite: 103, 218].
* Color Palette: Should align with the aesthetic and color scheme observed on `https://atasteofhanoi.com/`.

**Target Devices/Platforms:**
* The MVP will be a web application.
* It **must be designed with a "mobile-first responsive" approach**, ensuring it functions effectively and provides a good user experience on both desktop and mobile browsers.

## Technical Assumptions

* **Primary Technology Stack:**
    * Frontend: Next.js (React)[cite: 74, 189].
    * Backend: Node.js (implicitly for Next.js backend functionalities or serverless functions)[cite: 74, 189].
    * Database & BaaS: Supabase (providing PostgreSQL database, authentication, and storage capabilities)[cite: 74, 189]. This stack was chosen for its comprehensive features, alignment with SQL preferences[cite: 75, 190], and to facilitate rapid development for the MVP.
* **Compliance Implementation Approach:** Secure handling of user data and adherence to privacy requirements (specifically Vietnam's Decree 13/2023/ND-CP for MVP [cite: 77, 192]) will be supported by leveraging Supabase's built-in security features [cite: 80, 195] and ensuring the application logic aligns with these requirements.
* **Development & Deployment Focus:** The selection of Next.js and Supabase is geared towards maximizing development speed and simplifying deployment[cite: 84, 199], which are crucial for the MVP phase.

* **Repository & Service Architecture:**
    * **Repository Structure:** A single repository (monorepo) will be used to house the Next.js application code[cite: 85, 200].
    * **Service Architecture:** A monolithic application structure utilizing Next.js is preferred for the MVP[cite: 81, 196]. This single application will manage both frontend rendering and its API routes/serverless functions for backend logic[cite: 82, 197]. Supabase will function as the comprehensive Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)[cite: 83, 198].
    * **Rationale:** This combined approach (monorepo and Next.js monolith with Supabase as BaaS) has been explicitly chosen to optimize for speed of development, operational simplicity, and ease of deployment[cite: 84, 199]. These factors are paramount given the aggressive 1-week timeline for the MVP.

* **MODIFIED: Data Model Design for Future Extensibility:**
    * As per the updated Project Brief, the MVP database schema must be designed to support future "Organization" functionality[cite: 86, 201]. This includes:
        * Placeholder structures or considerations for an `Organizations` table (e.g., id, name, manager_user_id)[cite: 87, 202].
        * Placeholder structures or considerations for an `OrganizationMembers` junction table (linking users/guides to Organizations)[cite: 88, 203].
        * The `Tours` table schema should include a nullable `organization_id` field (Foreign Key)[cite: 89, 204]. For MVP, this will be NULL as tours belong to individual guides[cite: 90, 205].
        * The `Bookings` table schema should include a nullable `assigned_guide_user_id` field (Foreign Key)[cite: 91, 206]. For MVP, this might be unused or could store the ID of the guide who owns the tour.
    * **Note:** The UI and application logic for creating and managing Organizations, inviting members, org-specific tours, and assigning guides to org bookings are **Post-MVP features**[cite: 93, 208]. The MVP focuses on individual guides and tourists; this database design is for future readiness.

### Testing requirements

Given the aggressive 1-week development timeline for the MVP, a pragmatic and focused testing approach is crucial. Quality assurance will prioritize validating core functionalities and critical user paths.

* **Primary Approach: Structured Manual Testing:**
    * The primary method for validating MVP functionality will be structured manual testing.
    * A concise set of test cases and user scenarios will be developed to cover the core features for Tourists, Tour Guides, and Admin users.
* **Secondary Approach: Focused Integration Testing:**
    * Targeted integration tests will be performed for key interactions between the Next.js frontend and the Supabase backend.
    * This will specifically cover the critical data flows and logic for:
        * The tourist booking process (data submission, storage, and confirmation).
        * The tour guide's tour creation and publishing process (data saving and display).
* **Automated End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
    * Comprehensive automated E2E tests are considered out of scope for the initial 1-week MVP sprint due to time constraints. These will be a key consideration for post-MVP development.
    * If development progress allows, a single "happy path" E2E test for the core tourist booking flow may be considered as a stretch goal, but manual and integration testing remain the priority.
* **Critically Tested Paths:**
    * Rigorous testing (manual and integration) will be mandatory for:
        * The core tourist booking funnel (from tour discovery to booking confirmation).
        * The guide's ability to successfully create, manage details for, and publish a new tour.
* **Quality Assurance Iteration:** While this outlines the MVP testing scope, quality assurance will be an ongoing effort, with more comprehensive testing strategies planned post-launch.

## Epic Overview

Here are the Epics and User Stories defined for the MVP, updated to include Booking Cancellation and Tour Categories.

* **Epic 1: Project Foundation & Core Platform Setup**
    * **Goal:** Establish the initial Next.js application structure, connect to Supabase for database and authentication (designing the schema for future Organization extensibility), set up initial fixed tour categories, set up basic automated deployment (e.g., to Vercel), and implement core user registration and login capabilities for all three user roles (Tourist, Tour Guide, Admin). This epic lays the essential technical groundwork and user access control for all subsequent features, including considerations for how guest user interactions (like bookings) are handled.
    * **User Stories for Epic 1:**
        * **Story 1.1: Initial Project Setup & Basic Deployment Pipeline** (ACs unchanged from initial definition)
        * **Story 1.2: User Role Definition & Foundational Data Model in Supabase**
            * *(Description unchanged from initial definition)*
            * **Modified/Add to Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
                * The Supabase `auth.users` table is utilized for core authentication.
                * A `user_roles` table or a `role` column within a `profiles` table (linked one-to-one with `auth.users`) is created to define user roles (e.g., 'tourist', 'guide', 'admin').
                * A `profiles` table (or role-specific profile tables like `guide_profiles`) is created to store additional user information not in `auth.users` (e.g., name, bio, photo URL), linked to `auth.users` via user ID.
                * The schema includes fields for common user attributes (e.g., ID, email, role, created_at, updated_at) and basic profile fields relevant to each role for MVP.
                * **The database schema design for `Tours` and `Bookings` must include placeholder fields (e.g., nullable `organization_id` in `Tours`[cite: 89, 204], nullable `assigned_guide_user_id` in `Bookings` [cite: 91, 206]) to accommodate future Organization functionality as detailed in the Project Brief, even if these fields are not used by MVP application logic for individual guide tours.**
                * **Initial considerations for `Organizations` [cite: 87, 202] and `OrganizationMembers` [cite: 88, 203] table structures are made, even if these tables are not fully implemented or populated for MVP application logic.**
                * (Iterative Schema) The initial schema focuses only on the data absolutely necessary for MVP user roles, basic profile info, and the groundwork for future extensibility.
        * **Developer Setup Task (associated with Epic 1): Define Initial Fixed List of Tour Categories**
            * **Task Description:** As a Developer, during initial platform setup, I will populate the database (or define in configuration) with an initial, fixed list of approximately 3-5 agreed-upon tour categories (e.g., 'Day tours', 'Night tours', 'Adventure', 'Cultural', 'Culinary'), so that these categories are available for guides to assign to their tours and for tourists to use in discovery and filtering.
            * **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
                * A `categories` table (or equivalent simple structure like an enum type) is created in the Supabase database if not covered by Story 1.2.
                * The table/structure is populated with the initial, predefined list of tour categories.
                * This predefined list of categories is accessible by the tour creation/editing interface for guides and by the tour discovery/filtering features for tourists.
        * **Story 1.3: User Registration for Tourists and Aspiring Guides** (ACs unchanged from initial definition)
        * **Story 1.4: Unified User Login & Logout Functionality** (ACs unchanged from initial definition)
        * **Story 1.5: Basic Platform Layout, Navigation Shell, and Styling Foundation**
            * **Modified AC:** The header displays the platform name (or placeholder logo) and provides basic navigation links (e.g., Home, Tours, **Browse by Category links/dropdown**, Login/Register). Navigation links dynamically adapt based on user authentication status and role. (Other ACs unchanged).
        * **Story 1.6: Initial Admin User Creation Process** (ACs unchanged from initial definition)

* **Epic 2: Tour Guide Onboarding & Tour Creation MVP**
    * **Updated Goal:** Enable authenticated Tour Guides to complete their profile (name, photo, bio) and to create, edit, and publish detailed tour listings. Listings must include title, description, price, location, duration, images, capacity, **assignment to a predefined category,** and the "Guide's Story" using a rich-text editor. This delivers the core supply-side functionality for the platform.
    * **User Stories for Epic 2:**
        * **Story 2.1: Tour Guide Profile Completion & Management** (ACs unchanged from initial definition)
        * **Story 2.2: Initiate New Tour Listing & Define Core Details**
            * **Modified Description:** As an authenticated Tour Guide, I want to start creating a new tour listing by providing its essential details such as title, a concise description, price, general location, duration, maximum participant capacity, inclusions, exclusions, **and assign it to a predefined category,** so that the fundamental aspects of my tour are captured and it can be appropriately classified for tourists.
            * **Add to Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
                * The tour creation/editing form includes a mandatory dropdown or selection mechanism for the guide to choose **one category** for the tour from a predefined, fixed list of categories (populated from the list set up in Epic 1).
                * The selected category (e.g., its ID or unique name) is saved and associated with the tour record in the database.
                * The `tours` table schema in Supabase is updated to include a field to store the assigned category for each tour (and considers the nullable `organization_id` for future use [cite: 89, 204]).
        * **Story 2.3: Enhance Tour Listing with Images** (ACs unchanged from initial definition)
        * **Story 2.4: Craft "Guide's Story" for Tour Listing with Rich-Text Editor** (ACs unchanged from initial definition)

* **Epic 3: Tourist Tour Discovery & Viewing MVP**
    * **Updated Goal:** Enable prospective and registered Tourists to browse all published tours, **browse tours by specific predefined categories,** perform simple searches (e.g., by keyword), **filter tours by category,** and view detailed tour pages. These pages will display comprehensive tour information (including its category), the "Guide's Story", and the Tour Guide's basic profile. This delivers enhanced core demand-side discovery functionality.
    * **User Stories for Epic 3:**
        * **Story 3.1: Public Tour Listings Page (Browse All Tours)**
            * **Add to Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
                * The main tour listings page may prominently display links, buttons, or a section for Browse by the predefined categories, allowing users to navigate to the respective category pages (as per Story 3.5).
        * **Story 3.2: Simple Keyword Search & Category Filter for Tours** (Title Modified)
            * **Modified Description:** As a Visitor or registered Tourist, I want to use a simple keyword search functionality **and a category filter** on the tour listings page, so that I can quickly find tours relevant to my interests based on keywords or by selecting a specific, predefined tour type/category.
            * **Add/Modify Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
                * The tour listings page (or main search interface area) includes a filter option (e.g., a dropdown menu) that allows users to select a single tour category from the predefined list.
                * When a category is selected from the filter, the displayed list of tours updates to show only those tours belonging to the selected category (and also matching any active keyword search).
                * If both a keyword search and a category filter are active, results must match both criteria.
                * A clear indication of any active filters (search term, selected category) is provided, along with an easy way to reset or clear all filters to view all tours again.
        * **Story 3.3: Detailed Tour Page Viewing**
            * **Add to Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**

            * **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
                * A clear mechanism exists for users to access category-specific tour listing pages (e.g., from a list/menu of available categories displayed on the main tours page or in the site navigation).
                * Each category page dynamically lists all "Published" tours that have been assigned to that specific category.
                * The tour cards displayed on these category pages use the same visual format and show the same key information as on the main tour listings page (as per Story 3.1).
                * The category page clearly indicates to the user which category of tours is currently being viewed (e.g., a heading like "Showing tours in: Day Tours").
                * Basic pagination (e.g., "Load More" or page numbers) is implemented if the number of tours within a category is large.
                * If no tours are currently published within a selected category, a user-friendly message is displayed.

* **Epic 4: Guest & Authenticated Booking Flow with Initial Communication MVP**
    * **Updated Goal:** Enable **both unauthenticated (guest) and authenticated Tourists** to book an available tour by selecting date/time and providing necessary details, receiving on-screen and email confirmation. Implement basic spam/bot protection measures for guest bookings. **Enable tourists (registered and guest via email link) to cancel their bookings before the tour start, triggering notifications to Guides and Admins.** Tourists should also be able to submit pre-booking questions to guides. Authenticated Guides will be able to view and manage their incoming bookings (confirm/reject/see cancellations), and receive email notifications for new bookings, questions, **and cancellations**. Tourists will receive email notification of booking status changes **including cancellation**. This delivers the platform's primary transaction, communication, **and self-service cancellation capabilities** for all target tourists.

            * **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
                * An option to "Cancel Booking" is available for relevant bookings listed in the tourist's account (e.g., in a "My Bookings" section).
                * Cancellation is permitted if the request is made before a defined cut-off point (e.g., any time before the tour date for MVP).
                * Upon confirming cancellation, the booking status in the system changes to "Cancelled by Tourist."
                * The tourist receives an on-screen confirmation message of the cancellation.
                * The tour instance's available capacity is updated (i.e., spots are freed up).
        * **Story 4.10 (NEW): Guest Tourist Cancels Booking via Email Link**
            * **As a Guest Tourist who booked a tour, I want a unique link in my booking confirmation email that allows me to cancel my booking before the tour start time/date, so that I can manage my booking without needing an account.**
            * **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
                * The booking confirmation email sent to guest tourists (Story 4.5) must contain a unique, secure, and time-limited (or single-use) link to a cancellation page.
                * Clicking the cancellation link takes the guest to a page where they can confirm their intention to cancel the specific booking.
                * Upon confirmation on this page, the booking status in the system changes to "Cancelled by Guest."
                * The guest receives an on-screen confirmation message of the cancellation.
                * The tour instance's available capacity is updated.
                * The cancellation link should no longer be usable after successful cancellation or after the tour start time.
        * **Story 4.11 (NEW): System Notifications for Booking Cancellations**
            * **As a Tour Guide, I want to receive an email notification when a tourist (registered or guest) cancels a booking for one of my tours, so I am immediately aware of the change.**
            * **As an Admin, I want cancelled bookings to be clearly identifiable in the system, so I can monitor overall platform activity and booking statuses.**
            * **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
                * An automated email notification is sent to the Tour Guide's registered email address when any booking for their tours is cancelled. The email includes details of the cancelled booking (tour name, date, time, tourist identifier if available).
                * The booking status is updated to "Cancelled by Tourist" or "Cancelled by Guest" and is visible in the Tour Guide's booking management interface (Story 4.6).
                * The booking status is updated and visible in any Admin views that list bookings.

* **Epic 5: Admin Essentials - User/Tour Oversight & Basic Dashboard MVP**
    * **Updated Goal:** Provide authenticated Admin users with the essential tools to manage user accounts (view, activate/deactivate, assign roles), tour listings (view all, edit key details including **category consistency**, unpublish if necessary), **and view booking information including cancellations.** Admins will also have access to a simple dashboard displaying key platform statistics (e.g., total users by role, total active tours, total bookings). This ensures basic platform integrity, support, and monitoring.
    * **User Stories for Epic 5:**
        * **Story 5.1: Admin Dashboard with Key Platform Statistics**
            * **Modified AC (minor):** The dashboard displays the following statistics for MVP: Total number of registered Tourists; Total number of registered Tour Guides; Total number of "Published" tours; Total number of tour bookings made (across all statuses: Pending, Confirmed, Rejected, **Cancelled**), including guest bookings.
        * **Story 5.2: Admin - View and Manage User Accounts** (ACs unchanged from initial definition)
        * **Story 5.3: Admin - View and Manage Tour Listings**
            * **Add to Acceptance Criteria (ACs):** When viewing or editing tour details, Admins can see and modify the category assigned to the tour (from the predefined list).

## Initial Architect Prompt

Based on our discussions and requirements analysis for the **Unique Tours Platform** (PRD v1.2), I've compiled the following technical guidance to inform your architecture analysis and decisions to kick off Architecture Creation Mode:

### Technical Infrastructure

* **Repository & Service Architecture Decision:** A single repository (monorepo) will house the Next.js application code[cite: 85, 200]. A monolithic application structure using Next.js is preferred for the MVP[cite: 81, 196]. Supabase will serve as the comprehensive Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)[cite: 83, 198].
* **Starter Project/Template:** New project, standard Next.js initialization.
* **Hosting/Cloud Provider:** Vercel for Next.js hosting/CI/CD. Supabase for BaaS.
* **Frontend Platform:** Next.js (React)[cite: 74, 189].
* **Backend Platform:** Node.js (for Next.js backend/serverless functions)[cite: 74, 189]. Supabase for BaaS.
* **Database Requirements:** PostgreSQL via Supabase. **The schema must be designed for future extensibility to support an "Organization Model" as detailed in this PRD (Story 1.2 ACs and Project Brief sections on Database Design), even though MVP application logic focuses on individual guides.**

### Technical Constraints

* **Aggressive Timeline:** Original 1-week MVP sprint target [cite: 70, 185] is now significantly impacted by added features (cancellation, categories). Please provide a revised estimate.
* **Hosting Budget:** Initial monthly costs within $50-$100[cite: 71, 186].
* **Compliance:** Adherence to Vietnam's Decree 13/2023/ND-CP for MVP.
* **Mandated Stack:** Next.js, Supabase[cite: 74, 189].

### Deployment Considerations

* **CI/CD:** Basic automated CI/CD pipeline to Vercel.
* **Deployment Target:** MVP launch (timeline needs reassessment).
* **Environments:** Local, Vercel preview, Vercel production.

### Local Development & Testing Requirements

* **Local Environment:** Developers run Next.js locally, connect to Supabase.
* **Testing Strategy (MVP):** Manual testing of core features (including cancellation, categories); Focused integration testing for booking, cancellation, tour creation with categories.
* **Critically Tested Paths:** Tourist booking funnel (including cancellation); Guide tour creation (including category assignment).

### Other Technical Considerations

* **Scalability:** Architecture should allow future scaling[cite: 72, 187].
* **Security:** Secure PII handling via Supabase features[cite: 80, 195]. Spam/bot protection for guest actions. Secure guest cancellation links.
* **User Interface:** Mobile-first responsive design.
* **Technical Debt:** Acknowledge and manage[cite: 100, 215].
* **Points for Architect Investigation (from PM Checklist & new features):**
    * Spam/bot protection details.
    * Secure guest booking cancellation links.
    * Efficient querying for categories/filtering.
    * Impact of AI coding assistance[cite: 96, 211].
    * Detailed backup/recovery beyond Supabase defaults (if needed for specific RPO/RTO post-MVP).
    * Detailed fault tolerance mechanisms.
    * Specific performance monitoring approach (post-MVP).
    * Code/architecture documentation standards.
    * Defining detailed API specifications.
    * Operational alerting mechanisms (post-MVP).
    * **Ensuring MVP data model correctly anticipates future Organization needs without over-complicating the initial build or significantly impacting the MVP timeline**[cite: 102, 217].

Please use this PRD (v1.2) and the above guidance to create the technical architecture and solution design for the Unique Tours Platform MVP. **Please also provide an updated estimate on the development timeline given the expanded scope.**
