# Project Brief: Unique Tours Platform

## Executive Summary

The Unique Tours Platform is an online marketplace designed to connect travelers seeking authentic, off-the-beaten-path experiences with local guides who offer them. The platform addresses a gap in the current tourism market, where mainstream booking sites often overlook unique and specialized tours. By providing dedicated tools for local guides to showcase their offerings and for tourists to discover them, the platform's key value proposition is to facilitate the booking of memorable, non-traditional adventures, empowering local entrepreneurs in the process.

## Problem Statement

The current tourism market is dominated by large booking platforms that favor high-volume, standardized tours. This creates a dual-sided problem:
1.  **For Tourists:** It is difficult to discover unique, offbeat, and authentic local experiences that go beyond generic itineraries. Travelers seeking more personalized and memorable adventures find their options limited on these mainstream channels.
2.  **For Local Guides:** Guides who offer specialized, niche tours struggle to gain visibility and effectively manage bookings on platforms not designed for their unique offerings. They lack the right tools to share the rich narratives and distinctive qualities of their tours, making it hard to compete with larger operators.
Existing solutions fall short by not catering to the niche market of unique, story-driven tours. This project is crucial now to bridge the gap between these providers and the growing segment of travelers seeking more authentic experiences.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is a dedicated online marketplace, the "Unique Tours Platform," that directly connects discerning tourists with local guides offering unconventional tours.
* **Core Concept:** The platform will serve as a trusted source for finding and booking unique adventures that are not easily found elsewhere. It will empower guides with tools to create, promote, and manage their tours effectively.
* **Key Differentiators:** Unlike mainstream platforms, our focus is exclusively on "unique, offbeat, and authentic" experiences. The platform will emphasize the guide's personal story and the uniqueness of their tours through features like a "Guide's Story" profile section and rich tour descriptions.
* **Why it will succeed:** By catering specifically to the underserved niche of unique tours, the platform will build a dedicated community of both "Explorer" tourists and "Storyteller" guides, creating a focused ecosystem that mainstream competitors cannot easily replicate. The vision is to become the leading global platform for this market segment.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: Tourists ("Explorers")

* **Profile:** Discerning travelers who are tired of mainstream tourism and actively seek authentic, unique, and personalized experiences. They value storytelling and local connections over high-volume, generic tours.
* **Needs and Pain Points:** Difficulty finding non-traditional tours, lack of a trusted platform for such bookings, desire for more direct communication with local experts.
* **Goals:** To find and book memorable, off-the-beaten-path adventures and connect with the local culture on a deeper level.

### Primary User Segment: Individual Tour Guides ("Storytellers" / "Local Experts")

* **Profile:** Passionate local experts, often operating as individuals, who offer specialized tours based on their unique knowledge and interests.
* **Needs and Pain Points:** Lack of visibility on large platforms, difficulty managing bookings and availability, no effective way to communicate the unique value of their tours.
* **Goals:** To reach a targeted audience of interested travelers, easily manage their tour offerings and bookings, and share their passion with the world.

* **Booking Volume:** Number of tour bookings processed. Target: 5-10 in the first two weeks.
* **Platform Uptime:** Core feature availability. Target: 99%+.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

* **For Tourists:**
    * **Tour Discovery:** Browse and search for unique tours. This is essential for users to find relevant experiences.
    * **Tour Details Viewing:** View detailed tour pages with descriptions, guide profiles, and availability. This is crucial for making a booking decision.
    * **Booking & Communication:** Select a date, book a tour, and contact the guide with questions. This is the core functionality for platform validation.
* **For Individual Tour Guides:**
    * **Account & Profile Management:** Create an account and a "Guide's Story" profile. This is essential for building trust and showcasing uniqueness.
    * **Tour Management:** Create, edit, and publish tour listings. This is the primary way guides can offer their services.
    * **Availability & Booking Management:** Set tour availability and manage incoming booking requests. This is critical for guide operations.
* **For Admin:**
    * **User & Tour Oversight:** Basic ability to view and manage users and tour listings to ensure platform quality.

### Out of Scope for MVP

* **Organization Accounts:** All features related to tour companies (creating organization profiles, inviting members, managing org tours) are explicitly post-MVP. The database, however, will be designed to support this.
* **Online Payments:** The MVP will facilitate bookings, but direct online payment processing and commission handling are deferred.
* **Reviews and Rating System:** A formal system for user reviews will be developed post-MVP.
* **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Initial search will be basic; complex filtering (by price, duration, tags, etc.) is a future enhancement.
* **Tourist User Accounts:** Tourists can book as guests; persistent user accounts with booking history are post-MVP.

### MVP Success Criteria

A successful MVP launch is defined by the deployment of a stable platform by the target date (June 4, 2025) that allows tourists to successfully book tours from the initial cohort of 5-10 individual guides, thereby validating the core user flow and market proposition.

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features

* **Organization Account Functionality (High Priority):** Introduce capabilities for tour organizations to manage their guides and tours under a single banner.
* **Online Payments & Commission System:** Integrate a secure payment gateway to handle transactions and automate platform commissions.
* **Reviews and Rating System:** Implement a robust system for tourists to review guides and tours, building trust and social proof.
* **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Enhance tour discovery with more granular search options.
* **Tourist User Accounts:** Allow tourists to create accounts to manage their bookings and profile.

### Long-term Vision

In 1-2 years, the platform aims to be the leading online destination for discovering unique tours globally. This includes expanding into new geographic markets, fostering a vibrant community through content and forums, and potentially developing mobile applications to enhance the on-the-go experience for travelers.

### Expansion Opportunities

* **New Markets:** Strategically enter new countries and regions known for unique tourism opportunities.
* **New Use Cases:** Expand from tours to include unique workshops, local dining experiences, and other specialized activities.
* **Integrations:** Integrate with travel blogs, external calendars, and other relevant third-party platforms to increase reach and utility.

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements

* **Target Platforms:** Web (desktop and mobile responsive).
* **Performance Requirements:** The platform must be scalable to handle initial traffic with low hosting costs, supporting core features with 99%+ uptime.

### Technology Preferences

* **Frontend:** Next.js (React)
* **Backend:** Node.js
* **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
* **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Cloud-based, with initial monthly costs of $50-$100.

### Architecture Considerations

* **Service Architecture:** A monolithic Next.js application with Supabase as the Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) for the MVP.
* **Repository Structure:** A single monorepo for the MVP.
* **Database Design:** The schema will be designed to be extensible for future "Organization" functionality from day one, including `Organizations` and `OrganizationMembers` tables and nullable foreign keys on the `Tours` and `Bookings` tables.
* **Security/Compliance:** Must adhere to general data privacy best practices, with initial consideration for Vietnam's Decree 13/2023/ND-CP on Personal Data Protection (PDPD).

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

* **Timeline:** An aggressive 1-week development sprint for the MVP, targeting a launch around June 4, 2025.
* **Budget (Hosting):** Initial monthly hosting costs must be kept within a $50-$100 budget.
* **Resources:** Development will rely on AI coding assistance.
* **Technical:** The technology stack of Next.js, Node.js, and Supabase is mandated.

### Key Assumptions

* It is possible to build and deploy a stable, functional MVP within the aggressive 1-week timeline.
* The chosen "unique and offbeat" value proposition is distinct enough to attract an initial user base of both guides and tourists.
* The initial cohort of 5-10 guides can be successfully onboarded to provide a compelling initial offering of tours.
* The database model designed for future extensibility will not significantly complicate or delay the MVP build.

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

* **Timeline:** The 1-week MVP development timeline is highly aggressive and carries a high risk of delay or feature compromise.
* **Scope Creep:** The clear distinction between MVP and post-MVP features must be strictly maintained.
* **Market Adoption:** As a new platform, attracting the first wave of both guides and tourists presents a significant challenge.
* **Technical Debt:** Rapid development may lead to technical debt that will need to be addressed post-launch.
* **Data Model Complexity:** Ensuring the MVP data model correctly anticipates future Organization needs without over-complicating the initial build is a key technical risk.

### Open Questions

* What are the most effective channels for recruiting the initial 5-10 "Storyteller" guides?
* How will the "booking" be handled in the MVP without an integrated payment system? (e.g., a request/confirmation flow)
* What specific aspects of Vietnam's Decree 13 require immediate attention for the MVP launch?

### Areas Needing Further Research

* **User Acquisition Strategy:** A more detailed plan for attracting initial guides and tourists is needed.
* **Compliance Deep Dive:** A thorough review of Decree 13 is needed to create a compliance checklist for the MVP.
* **Competitive Feature Analysis:** Post-MVP, a deeper analysis of competitors will inform the feature roadmap.
